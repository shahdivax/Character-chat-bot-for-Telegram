Yes
Yes
He's asleep!
Sorry about him. He doesn't understand what it's like
Anytime.
Ow!
I swear I don't know!    One minute
Will I have to wear that
But that's Dudley's old uniform. It'll fit me like bits of old
Elephant skin.
Hey
Because there's no post on Sunday?
Get off! Ahh!
They're my letters! Let go of me!
Make a wish
I-I am.
Thank you!
Excuse me
Sorry
Learned what?
I-I'm a what?
No
Dear
You knew? You knew all along and you never told me?
Blown up? You told me my parents died in a car crash!
Muggle?
Okay.
First year students will require: three sets of work robes
One pair of dragon-hide gloves.    Hagrid
But you like a dragon?
All students must be equipped with...one standard size two
pewter cauldron and may bring if they desire either an owl
Oh
Goodbye.
But why am I famous
But
Uh
What's in there
I still need...a wand.
Hello? Hello?
Sorry
And...who owned that wand?
Wow.
He killed my parents
Maybe if you wrote it down?
Voldemort?
Me? Voldemort tried to kill...me?
What happened to...to You-Know-Who?
Platform 9Â¾? But
Excuse me
Excuse me
Muggles?
Excuse me! C-could you tell me how to-
No
I'm Harry. Harry Potter.
The what?
Oh
We'll take the lot!
Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans?
These aren't real chocolate frogs
I got Dumbledore!
Hey
A little.
Yeah!
Hey
I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself
Ahh!
Nothing... nothing
Not Slytherin. Not Slytherin.
Not Slytherin...anything but Slytherin.
Wow.
Say
What's he teach?
I think she fancies you.
We got lost.
I don't know
I don't know
Clearly
What's Seamus trying to do to that glass of water?
Can I borrow this?    Thanks.
Hey
Wow.
Neville!
Give it here
Give it here
A century
But I've never even played Quidditch. What if I make a fool of
myself?
I-I didn't know.
Who doesn't?
What's happening?
Let's go this way.
Does anyone feel like...we shouldn't be here?
Let's go.
Run!
Quick! Letâ€™s hide though that door!
It's locked!
And for good reason.
Guarding something?
I think so. What are those?
What is that?
I like this ball.
What do I do with it?
Whoa.
I think we're going to need another feather over here
I think she heard you.
Where's Hermione?
How could a troll get in?
Hermione! She doesn't know!
Itâ€™s going into the Girl's Bathroom!
Hermione
Whooa! Whoa
Whoa
Do something!
Anything! Hurry up!
I don't think so. Just knocked out.   Ew. Troll bogies.
Well
Good for you to get us out of trouble like that.
Mind you
I'm not hungry.
That explains the blood.
Listen
The day I was at Gringotts
That's what the dog's guarding. That's what Snape wants.
But I-I never get mail.
It's a broomstick!
But who...?
A little.
What happened?
Yes!    Whoa!
Yes!
Whoa! Whooa!
Who knows? Why was he trying to get past that three-headed dog
on Halloween?
Yes?
But
Exactly.
Nicholas Flamel?
Nicholas Flamel.    Who's Nicholas Flamel?
Knight to E5.
Happy Christmas
I-I've got presents?
Your father left this in my possession before he died. It is
time it was returned to you. Use it well.
It's some kind of cloak.
My body's gone!
I'm invisible?
There was no name. It just said use it well.
Famous fire eaters...15th Century Fiends...Flamel...Nicholas
Flamel...where are you?
Mum?    Dad?
Ron! You've really got to see this! Ron! You've got to see
this! Ron
There's something you've got to see. Now
Come on. Come. Come look
Look in properly. Go on. Stand there. There. You see them
How can it? Both my parents are dead.
No.
No.
So
Hi
Malfoy.
I found him!
Go on.
I knew the name sounded familiar. I read it on the train that
day.
The what?
Shh!
Hagrid!
We know about the Philosopher's Stone!
We think Snape's trying to steal it.
Hagrid
What?
Wait a minute.    One of the teachers?
Uh
Norbert?
Malfoy.
Hagrid always wanted a dragon. He told me so the first time I
met him.
I don't understand. Is that bad?
50?!
Hagrid
If I didn't know better
What is it
But what was that thing you saved me from?
But who would choose such a life?
Do you mean to say...that that thing that killed the
unicorn...that was drinking its blood...that was Voldemort?
The Philosopher's Stone.
But he's weak. He's living off the unicorns. Don't you see? We
had it wrong! Snape doesn't want the Stone for himself; he wants the Stone
for Voldemort. With the Elixir of Life
I think if he'd had the chance
My scar. It keeps burning.
Not like this.
I think it's a warning. It means dangers coming. Uhh!   Oh. Of
course!
Don't you think it's a bit odd that what Hagrid wants more
than anything is a dragon
The stranger
And did he seem interested in Fluffy?
We have to see Professor Dumbledore
He's gone?! Now? But this is important! It's about...the
Philosopher's Stone.
Someone's going to try and steal it.
That was no stranger Hagrid met in the village. It was Snape
We go down the trapdoor. Tonight.
Trevor.
Now
Let's go.    Sorry.
Snape's already been here. He's put a spell on the harp.
We have to move its paw.
Come on! Okay. Push! I'll go first. Don't follow until I
give you a sign. If something bad happens
Jump! Go!
Whoa!   Oh. Ahh!
Hermione!!
Hermione! Where are you?!
Yeah
Apparently not.
What?
Ron
Okay.
Lucky Hermione pays attention in Herbology.
I don't know. Sounds like wings.
They're not birds
I don't know. Strange.
There! I see it!      The one with the broken wing!
It's too simple.
Catch the key!
Where are we? A graveyard.
There's the door.
Wait a minute.
No
He's going to sacrifice himself!
RON!    NO! Don't move! Dont forget
Not as good as you.
You?    No. I-it canâ€™t be. Snape
But-but that day
Snape was trying to save me?
Then-then you let the troll in.
I-Iâ€™m shaking hands with Dumbledore. Iâ€™ve won the House
Cup.
Voldemort.
Never!
You liar!
Admirers?
Ron was here? Is he all right? What about Hermione?
But
But Flamel
How is it I got the Stone
Does that mean
What is it?
All right there
All right. Hermione?
One minute.
Thanks
But Hagrid
I'm not going home. Not really.
I can't let you out
Now you've done it.
But she's bored! If I could only let outonly let out for an
hour or two.
But I haven't had any messages from any of my friendsâ€¦ not
oneâ€¦ all summer.
I'll be in my bedroom
Who are you?
Not to be to be rude or anything
Why don't you sit down?
Dobby
You can't have met many decent wizards then.
Stop
Dobby
Dobby
Stop! Stop
Your family?
What terrible things? Who's plotting them?
Okâ€“ I- understand. You can't- say.
Dobby! Dobby
Give me the lamp! Dobby stop!
Get in there
I- I was justâ€”
Sorry.
Yes
Well
Give me those
Dobby
Dobby
I can't. Hogwarts is my home!
Ron! Fred. George. What are you all doing here?
Ahh- ahh!
Let go of me!
Get off!
I think it's brilliant
Hello. W-what did I do?
Raids?
Oh
Oh
Oh
Floo powder?
'Diaganilly.'
I'm fine
No! Please!
Hagrid!
I was lost
Well
I definitely need to remember that one.
Thank you. Bye.
Voldemort killed my parents. He was nothing more than a
murderer.
Let's go.
Aah!
Sorry. Lost- lost control of the trolley. Why can't we get
through?
The train leaves at exactly eleven o'clock. We've missed it!
Maybe we should just go and wait by the car.
Ron
Well come on
Now all we need to do is catch up with the train.
Do you hear that?
Hold onâ€¦
Aaahhh! Aaahhhh! Aaahhh!
Wha-aahhh!
I'm trying. Your hand's all sweaty.
I think we found the train.
Up! Up!
Up! Up! Ron! Mind that tree!
Ahh!
Be thankful it's not your neck.
I don't know.
Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!
Aaaahhhh!
Come on! Go! Fast!
Ahh!
See you
Professor Dumbledore. Professor McGonagall.
You're doomed.
Oh- Hi
Stop! Stop! Hold still!
Malfoy?
No
He'll know what to do.
Ah! Ohâ€¦ Okay.
Malfoy. He called Hermione
What's a Mudblood?
That's horrible!
Not really.
What?
That voice.
Didn't you hear it?
Spooky.
Did you hear it?
That voice.
I heard it first in Lockhart's office. And then again justâ€”
It's moving. I think it's going to kill.
Strange. I've never seen spiders act like that.
Oh
No. No.
It's not true sir
When I said I wasn't hungry. We were heading back to the
common room when we found Mrs. Norris.
Strange?
Do you think I should have told them? Dumbledore and the
others
Well
Well
Well
A month? But
Wood! Look out!
Thank you.
No
No
Ugh!
Uh!
Dobby?
It was youâ€¦ You stopped the barrier from letting Ron and me
through.
You nearly got Ron and me expelled!
Your Bludger? You made that Bludger chase after me?
You'd better clear off before my bones come back
I don't suppose you could tell me why you're trying to kill
me?
Why do you wear that thing Dobby?
Repeat itself? You mean this has happened before?
Dobby
No
Thank you
You wish.
Rictusempra!
Sya- hassa- she. Sya- hasi- heth. Sya- hasi- heth.
I'm a what?
I know. I mean
What's bad? If I hadn't told that snake not to attack Justin.
You were there! You heard me!
I spoke a different language? But- I didn't realize I- how can
I speak a language without knowing I can?
But I'm notâ€¦ I can't be.
I'll see you back in the common room.
No! Mr. Filch! Y-you- you don't understand!
Professorâ€¦ I swear I didn't!
Professor Dumbledore?
Iâ€¦ I-I was- I was just wondering if you'd put me in the
right house.
You're wrong.
Professor! Sir
You don't think it was me
No
Crabbe and Goyle.
Ron
Wingardium leviosa. Here they come.
Come on. Let's get 'em.
Ughh!
Ron!
We still sound like ourselves. You need to sound more like
Crabbe.
Excellent.
Hermione
Come on.
I think the Slytherin common room's this way.
I'mâ€¦
Ah- umâ€¦ Reading.
Uh-huh.
You're wrong!
Harry Potter?
But then you must have some idea who's behind it all.
It's hisâ€¦ stomachache. Calm down.
Hair!
Hermione
Hermione? A- are you OK?
She should be out of hospital in a few days
Looks like Moaning Myrtle's flooded the bathroom.
Why would I throw something at you?
But
'Tom Marvolo Riddle.'
'My name is Harry Potter.'
'Do you know anything about the Chamber of Secrets?'
'Can you tell me?'
Excuse me. Could you tell me what's going on here? Are you Tom
Riddle?
Dumbledore?
Hagrid! Haagriid!
Woah!
It was Hagrid. Hagrid opened the Chanter of Secrets fifty
years ago.
The monster had killed somebody
No!
W- what's that you've got
And they found it. Tom Riddle's diary is gone.
No.
We've got to talk to Hagrid
I think it's time to get my Dad's old cloak out again.
What's that for?
Hagrid
Did you hear about Hermione?
Look
Look! Well
You heard what Hagrid said
Shush!
Come on!
Don't panic.
We're friends of Hagrid's. And you? Y- y-you're Aragog aren't
you?
He's in trouble. Up at the school
Then you're not the monster.
Shush. But if you're not the monster
But have you seen it?
What?
Well
One
Let's go! Arania exumai! Go!
Whoah!
Arania exumai!
Don't mention it. Get us out of here. Now! Come on! Come on!
Move faster!
Aah!
Go on! Go! Get us in the air.
Come on! Pull!
We know one thing. Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets.
He was innocent.
Wish you were here Hermione. We need youâ€¦ now
Ron
'Of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land
Because no one did look it in the eye. Not directly
The water. There was water on the floor that night. She only
saw the basilisk's reflection. 'Spiders flee before it.' It all fits!
Hermione's answered that
Remember what Aragog said
Lockhart may be useless
Professor
You're running away? After all that stuff you did in your
books?
You wrote them!
You're a fraud! You've just been taking credit for what other
wizards have done!
Don't even think about it.
To ask you how you died.
Who was it Myrtle?
Just like that? How?
This is it. This is it
Hesha- Hassah.
Oh
All right. Let's go.
Uhâ€¦thanks Myrtle.
Aaah!
Now remember
This way.
It's a snakeskin.
Ron! Ron
You wait here and try and shift some of this rock so we can
get back through. I'll go on and find Ginny!
Hesha- Hassah.
Ginnyâ€¦ Ginny! Oh
Tom. Tom Riddle! What do you mean
Are you a ghost?
She's cold as ice. Ginny
Give me my wand
Listen
No. She couldn't. She wouldn't!
But why?
But
Hagrid's my friend! And you framed him
I'll bet Dumbledore saw right through you.
Well
Why do you care how I escaped? Voldemort was after your time.
You! You're the Heir of Slytherin. You're Voldemort.
Albus Dumbledore is the greatest sorcerer in the world!
He'll never be gone! Not as long as those who remain are loyal
to him! Fawkes?
Ginny-
Ginnyâ€¦
Don't worry. Ginny
Yes
Yes
It's justâ€¦ You see
Voldemort transferred some of his powersâ€¦ to me?
So the Sorting Hat was right! I should be in Slytherin.
Because I asked it to.
Godric Gryffindor.
Dobby! So this is your master! The family you serve is the
Malfoys
Don't worry. I will be.
Lumos Maxima. Lumos Maxima. Lumos Maxima. Lumos Maxima. Lumos
Maxima!
Uncle Vernon
Nothing. School stuff.
I will if she does.
Yes.
Okay.
Oh
That's a lie!
My dad wasn't a drunk!
Shut up! Shut up!
No! She deserved what she got! Keep away from me.
Yeah? Try me.
I don't care. Anywhere's better than here.
I fell over.
I didn't do it on purpose.
Nothing.
I didn't.
The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London.
But the Muggles. Can't they see us?
Who is that? That man.
How did he escape?
Yeah. Him I've heard of.
Hedwig.
No
I don't understand.
I broke the law. Underage wizards can't use magic at home.
The state of things
Sirius Black
Hedwig.
Egypt. What's it like?
Mrs. Weasley.
Good to see you.
Yes.
Yeah
Everything's there.
Thank you.
Mr. Weasley.
Yeah
Yeah. It should be great.
Has this anything to do with Sirius Black
Only that he's escaped from Azkaban.
Voldemort.
Sorry.
And kill me.
Mr. Weasley... why would I go looking for someone who wants to
kill me?
I didn't mean to blow her up. I just... I lost control.
I think I was lucky not to be arrested actually.
Do you think he's really asleep?
I gotta tell you something.
Yeah.
Thanks
I don't know. Maybe we've broken down.
Thank you.
What was that thing that came?
What happened to me?
And did either of you two... you know... pass out?
But someone was screaming. A woman.
How did he find out?
Fortuna Major.
Thank you.
She's still doing that after three years. She can't even sing.
Exactly. Hey
Shut up
What?
Hey
Brilliant
At least Hagrid didn't get fired.
But professor I thought if you signed it
Forget about it
Professor
I did think of Voldemort at first. But then I remembered that
night on the train... and the dementor.
Before I fainted... I heard something. A woman... screaming.
I think it was my mother... the night she was murdered.
The most haunted building in Britain. Yeah I know. What's
going on?
Excuse me
Sir
Probably a right sight better than he normally does.
Oh
What happened?
Really? I meant the match. Who won?
No. Professor
I'm scared
I need to know how to fight them. You could teach me. You made
that dementor on the train go away.
But you made it go away.
Guys
I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade.
Let me go! Come on
What are you doing?!
What's this rubbish?
Mr's. Moony
Hang on. This is Hogwarts. And that... No. Is that really...?
So you mean this map shows...
Everyone?
Brilliant! Where did you get it?
He was their friend... and he betrayed them. He was their
friend! I hope he finds me. Because when he does
I'm sure.
Expecto Patronum.
Expecto Patronum! Expecto... Expecto... Expect...
That's one nasty dementor.
The first time I rode a broom.
There's another. It's not... happy
Just do it. Expecto Patronum! Expecto Patronum!
I think I've had enough for today.
I was thinking of him. And Mom. Seeing their faces. They were
talking to me. Just talking. That's the memory I chose. I don't even know if
it's real. But it's the best I have.
Ripped to pieces? What are you talking about?
They're not sacking you!
You tell those spiders Ron.
Sorry.
Mischief managed. Nox.
I was sleepwalking.
My dad didn't strut. And nor do I. Now
Spare bit of parchment.
Mr's. Moony
And request that he keep his abnormally large nose out of
other people's business.
No. No
Yes
Professor
Peter Pettigrew.
It's just what I saw. Good night
Hang on. We better take this back.
Fine. See you later.
Professor Trelawney...
Sorry?
No. Nothing.
Why don't we just set him free?
Ow! Hagrid!
Hagrid. It'll be fine. It'll be okay.
What?
Wait!
That's not good. Ron
Ron! Ron! Ron! Ron! Come on! Move!
Don't worry.
I have a hunch. I just hope I'm wrong.
Come on. Ron.
Then it'll be you!
I know why. You betrayed my parents. You're the reason they're
dead!
Who was it
Expelliarmus!
Tell me about Peter.
No. Pettigrew's dead. You killed him!
The map was lying
All they could find of Pettigrew was his...
Show me. Give it to him
No!
I know what he is. But we'll take him to the castle.
Get off! I said we'd take you to the castle. After that
Okay.
No. Don't worry
You okay?
Well I just didn't think my dad would have wanted his two best
friends... to become killers. Besides
I know.
What? Come and live with you?
Expelliarmus!
Come on.
Sirius!
Sirius! No. Sirius! Expecto Patronum!
I saw my dad.
He sent the dementors away. I saw him across the lake.
You mean they're gonna kill him?
It's true. Sirius is innocent.
What just happened? Where's Ron?
I don't know. Going to Hagrid's?
Hermione! Hermione! Hermione
That's us.
This is not normal.
You mean we've gone back in time?
Good punch.
Come on. We should be at Hagrid's.
Look. Buckbeak's still alive.
Here they come. I'd better hurry.
That's Pettigrew.
He betrayed my parents. You don't expect me to sit here.
Are you mad?
Ow!
Ow! That hurt!
What?
Get away. Get off.
This way.
Come on. This way. This way
How?
And now we wait.
Yeah. Hermione?
Before
It was my dad. My dad conjured the Patronus.
You see Sirius talking to me there? He's asking me to come
live with him.
When we free him
Let's go! What are you doing?
Thanks. Great! Now he's coming for us.
Poor Professor Lupin's having a really tough night. Sirius!
Come on!
Don't worry. My dad will come. He'll conjure the Patronus. Any
minute now! Right there! You'll see!
Don't worry
Expecto Patronum!
You were right
I want to go with you.
But you're innocent.
My mother's eyes.
He's free. We did it.
I don't know. Honestly
You've been sacked.
Resigned? Why?
But Dumbledore...
None of it made any difference. Pettigrew escaped.
What are you talking about?
For me? But who sent it?
Hermione. Bad dream. When did you get here?
Last night.
Where are we actually going?
Yes sir. This way.
Pleasure to meet you too sir.
Why are they all standing around that manky old boot?
What's a 'portkey'?
Thanks.
See ya later Cedric.
I love magic.
When we're apart my heart beats only for youuu!
What is that?
Crime?
What crime?
Those people tonight
There was a man. Before. There.
I dunno. I didn't see his face.
It's alright I'll get it.
Oh no thank you I'm not hungry.
I'm fine.
Well there's something you don't see every day.
I don't know but I don't think it's Pumpkin Juice.
Yeah well rather you than me.
No sir.
No sir.
Yes sir.
Let you know what?
I didn't ask for this to happen Ron. Okay? You're being
stupid.
I didn't put my name in that cup. I don't want eternal glory I
just wanna be.. Look
It's a broomcupboard.
Oh
I'm fourteen.
I dunno I haven't really thought about it.
Fourteen.
No I didn't enter.
Hey
Sirius?
Sirius?! How...
No!
I dunno.
No. Umm.. Voldemort was giving him a job to do. Something
important.
He wanted... me. I dunno why
What are you saying?
Do you think one of them put my name in the goblet?
I'm not ready for this Sirius.
Someone's coming!
Who says I was talking to anyone.
Maybe you're imagining things
Neville! You're doing it again!
Magical water plants of the highland Lochs?
Is that right? Well.... what?
Well you can tell Ronald...
Yeah I brought the cloak. Hagrid where are we going?
What's with the flower? Hagrid have you combed your hair?
Dragons? That's the first task? You're joking.
Ron was here?
No he didn't. He didn't tell me a thing.
Thanks.
Excuse me..
Can I have a word?
Dragons. That's the first task. They've got one for each of
us.
Yes.
Don't worry about it.
You're a right foul git you know that?
I know so.
Yeah. Stay away from me.
I don't give a damn what you or your father thinks Malfoy.
He's vile and cruel
Oh... um... You know I just thought I'd...
Um... I dunno.. I can fly. I mean I'm a fair flyer.
But I'm not allowed a broom.
Yeah.
Battle a dragon.
The horntail...
Nothing.
Who wants me to open it? You want me to open it?
What the bloody hell was that?
Caught on have you. Took you long enough.
Brilliant. That makes me feel loads better.
Hagrid warned me about the dragons.
Who could possibly figure that out? That's completely mental.
Well it does match your eyes. Is there a bonnet?
Oi! Never gonna let him forget this are you?
Why do they always have to travel in packs? How are you
supposed to get one alone to ask them...
I think I'd take the dragon right now.
But then again he can take himself.
Agreed.
Cho!
Ok thanks. Cho?
Um.    I just wondered if maybe you wanted to go to the ball
with me?
Um. I was just wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the ball
with me.
Ok. Great. Fine. No problem. Good.
What happened to you?
What did she say?
Don't be silly.
What did you do then?
Hey!
My dress robes.
Well I expect yours are more traditional.
Leave it alone.
Who?
Because we'd take the mickey out of her if she did.
Ready professor?
No.
Yeah she does.
What?
Really? I had no idea. I suppose Viktor's already figured it
out.
What's that supposed to mean?
Cedric.
Spectacular.
Forget about it. I'm sure you would have done the same for me.
I must be out of my mind.
Myrtle!
Polyjuice potion! Kicked the habit. Myrtle
Myrtle
Come seek us where our voices sound.
An hour long you'll have to look.
Potentially problematic? When was the last time you held your
breath under the water for an hour Hermione?
Neville. No offense
You're sure about this Neville.
For an hour.
Most likely?
You're telling me this now? You must be joking.
Well that makes you sight better than Ron and Hermione. Where
are they anyway?
Do I?
But she's my friend too!
Hermione
I finished last Hermione.
Mr Crouch?
I can come back later Professor.
Agh!
Professor?
Sir
It's just that I had a dream about him. It was in the summer
Yes. Always the same one. Sir... these dreams
Yes sir.
Bubble juice sir?
I haven't stolen anything.
Fleur? Fleur!
No stop! He's bewitched Cedric.
He's bewitched!
For a moment so did I.
Some game.
Together
Yeah
I've been here before.
I've been here before in a dream. Cedric
Get back to the cup!
Cedric!
Don't touch him.
Have it your way.
He's back
Not so much now.
The cup was a portkey. Someone had bewitched it.
Who?
I dunno. It was like I'd fallen into one of my dreams. One of
my nightmares.
Um. I don't think I said anything about a graveyard Professor.
It was you from the beginning. You put my name in the goblet
of fire. You bewitched Krum. But...
That's Moody
Professor
No I don't think so.
Yes.
Big D? Cool name
What?
Shut up
Because if you don't I'll turn you into the idiot pig you are!
Not so brave now
Don't you ever speak about that again. You understand?
I said
Quiet!
Dudley! Run!
Come on! They break into a run. A dementor drifts into the
alleyway in front of them. Skidding to a stop
Dudley
Lumos!
Expecto Patronum!'
Expecto Patronum! '
Dementors.
No.
We were attacked.
They're evil. If they get the chance
You can't give a Dementor the 'ol one-two.'
Because I used magic to save his
Lumos!
What are you doing here?
How'd he know? It just happened!
What's been going on? What's Lord Vol-
How are we getting there?
Uh
Expecto--!
No!
But I can help!
Was that your--?
But...why here?
Mrs. Weasley!
Right.
So
Didn't you bother asking?
So I get to spend the summer with the Dursleys while you two
are here.
You've still been here!
What's been going on?
What's this Order everyone's talking about?
Why?
Okay.
I'm not really hungry. I think I'll go to bed.
I wanted to
Where's Voldemort? What's he doing?
How?
And what's his plan?
And you're stopping him from gaining followers?
But...why?
But you're telling people
What?
What kind of weapon?
No
Yeah...nerves...
Thanks
Bye.
Department of Mysteries?
I've been there before...
Er...sorry.
Yes.
Yes
Yes
Yes.
But I did it because of the Dementors!
My cousin and I were attacked by Dementors. That's why I had
to use the Patronus
I think so
Er...is Percy mad at you?
What are you doing here?
If he wanted to talk to the Minister
Yeah...just...my scar...the pain is getting stronger.
My parents.
I miss them
Why'd they have to die
Thanks.
Who..who was that?
I'm sure. Nothing.
So...congratulations Ron
Yes
What is that?
Yes it is
Er...you are?
Well
Hagrid's cabin looks deserted.
Yeah
What?
Why?
What did I do?
Where'd she get that from?
No one believes me
I'm alone...
Sorry
What good's theory in the real world?
What about Lord Voldemort?
It-is-NOT-a-LIE!
So
It was MURDER! I saw it happen!
Yeah
Yeah. But she called me a liar!
Yes
Oh! Sorry...
I'll never get out of it
Later
Thanks.
There's no ink.
No
She is. But the quill has some sort of spell on it. It uses
blood for ink.
No
No!
I don't need his help. I don't need anyone's help.
I've asked Sirius about it.
Don't worry
Well
Yeah
Er...
Where are we going
Hermione
You mean about us teaching ourselves?
Hey
Uh...same to you
That's the first time you've said his name.
It's okay
I believe Voldemort's back because I fought him last year.
Dumbledore's already told the school that. If you didn't believe him you
won't believe anyone.
Me?
Uh...well
That might work. I'll look into that.
Yeah.
What's she done now?
By order of the Hogwarts High Inquisitor: All student
organizations
Not only that
This isn't a coincidence.
She knows.
Look
What would we do without you
Hedwig!
It's Hedwig. I think she's been attacked.
London.
Yes
Dobby! What are you doing here?
What is it
Don't worry about it
Actually
I need a room where twenty-eight people can practice Defense
Against the Dark Arts without the teachers knowing. Especially Professor
Umbridge.
That's brilliant
Better not
Just ignore them
Malfoy provoked us.
Ban us...for life.
You've--!
You can't!
If you quit
Hagrid
We know you were looking for giants
So what did you do when you found them?
Glad to see all of you could find this place all right.
Loads of Defense Against the Dark Arts equipment. Hopefully
we'll be able to get to all of it before the end of term.
Besides
Right. Well
Well done
Look here
Never forget this spell
Okay
Mr. Weasley's been attacked!
No
Oh. Uh...I was the snake. I saw it from the snake's
perspective.
Yes!
What's that
Voldemort can read minds?
So he could read our minds right now?
But hasn't it helped so far? I mean
What are you going to do?
No!
I've been there before...
I've just realized...
What's in the Department of Mysteries
That corridor
It's got to be.
Probably. Mr. Weasley was probably there when he was attacked
They're all Death Eaters!
Voldemort.
Professor
I'm so sorry
Are you sure you can't? Hagrid said it was important.
Could you tell us what it is
Yeah.
No!
I--sorry!
No
No--no
Voldemort! He's got Sirius! In the Department of Mysteries!
I just saw it.
How're we going to get there?
We've got to do something!
I won't let Sirius die!
Voldemort's broken into the Department of Mysteries. He's got
Sirius there!
There isn't anyone else
No
How?
That's all we'll need.
Grimmauld Place!
Sirius! Lupin? Hello?
Kreacher
You know where he is
It's none of your business.
He's got Padfoot at the place it's hidden!
You sent the Dementors?
Hermione
I would rather die!
Great plan
We've got no brooms.
What are those?
All right
All right
Where is everyone?
That's how Voldemort got in unnoticed.
This is it. Come on.
Stay close.
I don't understand. In my dream
Yeah. I'll know the way when I see it.
Who's there?
Sirius?
Does anyone else hear that?
Sirius...yeah...
Alohomora!
Whatever's in there
This is it! Come on!
This is it. This is where Sirius is!
He's in here somewhere.
What's my name doing here?
Why not?
It's got my name on it!
Where's Sirius?
What prophesy?
Go ahead.
Come and find out!
You even try to take her and I'll smash this thing.
So
Not really. How come Voldemort wants it?
Hey
What's so special about this
What?
So he used me to do his dirty work
Now!
Where'd the rest go?
Stupify!
Stupify!
Ron!
Pretificus Totalus!
Hermione!
Please don't be dead
Can we carry her?
I don't know...
What happened.
We need to get out of here. Luna
Let my friends go and I will.
Stop
Are you all right?
You come with us!
Protego!
No...no...no....
I'LL KILL you!!
Stupify!
Crucio!
Can't. It got smashed by accident!
How's Voldemort going to like that? You've failed him
He can't hear you from here
Look out!
Professor!
No you don't!
You don't have a clue! You can't possibly know!
I don't care! I don't care!
Let me out.
You can't keep me in here!
I already know all this.
Well
But Snape stopped giving me lessons.
He barely taught me
Sirius didn't trust him. Didn't believe he'd really turned to
our side...
I've been dreaming about that all year
But I checked Grimmauld Place! Kreacher said--
Why?
What?
Wait
And Hermione said we should be nice to Kreacher!
Sirius hated him.
Yeah
She never loved me.
I asked you why Voldemort tried to kill me.
I don't understand
Professor
Sir
I'm not sure I understand all that
And...it means me?
So it's not necessarily me
What if he chose wrong?
Why didn't he wait? Why attack when we were babies?
But I don't have any special powers.
What is it
One of us has to kill the other...in the end.
Hey
Oh. Thanks.
Nick
Expecting what?
I expect so...
Why?
How are you?
Better.
I've got something to tell you. Something important.
But not right now. I'm not ready.
Do you need any help looking?
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
Isn't it?
I've been thinking about something Dumbledore said to me.
That even though we've got a fight ahead of us we've got one
thing that Voldemort doesn't have.
Something worth fighting for
Oh.    Um.   No one.   Bit of a tosser.
Really.
Hey.    I was wondering...
I like riding round on the trains. It takes my mind off...
things.
I just Apparated
Can't imagine why...
After all these years
My mother's eyes
One of my best friends is Muggle- born.   She's the best in our
year.
Sir
It's alright
But
Sir?
Really.
Didn't know. Dumbledore.
When'd you get here?
Oh come on...
But we're talking about Hogwarts. Dumbledore. What could be
safer?
Rubbish.     He's only -- what?
Amazing.
Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder?
Reckon he's right...
Good.    Bad.   Speaking of which...
Dunno.    Let's get closer.
I don't know.     I'm turned around.
What just happened?
Don't you see
It's happened.     He's one of them.
So what's he doing in Borgin and Burke's?       Browsing for
furniture?
Look.    His father's a Death Eater. It only makes sense.
Besides
I need some air.
Luna.    How'd you...?
Sorry I made you miss the carriages
I am your friend
Professor Flitwick
Have you ever fixed one?      A nose.
What the hell.      Give it a go.
Well?    How do I look?
Brilliant.
Later.    What've I missed?
Thanks...
This can't be good.
Well
It is.    Or was.    But I was told I had to get an Outstanding in
my
Really?    Well... brilliant.    I'll head there straight away.
Um
Crush it.    Don't cut it.
No.    Really --
Fine
I think he overestimates my abilities
Definitely.
Sir?
No!    I mean... she's brilliant. And we're friends.     But... no.
Did you know
You didn't bring Professor Slughorn back simply to teach
Potions
You said Professor Slughorn would try to collect me.
Do you want me to let him?
All right!    Queue up!    Excuse me...
Thanks. All right. This morning I'll be putting you all
through a few drills to assess your strengths. But know this: Just because
you made the team last year does not guarantee you a spot this year. Is that
clear?
All right. Cormac. Ron.        It's down to you two for Keeper.
We'll decide it with a shootout. Demelza
Quiet! I'm Captain.       We do it my way.   Now line up.   On
three. One. Two... Three!
C'mon
Ever heard of this spell?
No.
It's... old.    The binding is fragile.
I didn't say I wasn't curious. And
The library.
And?
Good.    That settles it then.
Who's up for a Butterbeer?
No.    Over here.
No
Hello
So what brings you here
I'd consider it an honor
Dumbledore asked me to... get to know him.
Dunno.    But it must be important. Otherwise Dumbledore
wouldn't ask.
There's no time!
She was cursed
It was Malfoy.
I... just... know.
What does she see in him?
You called him a slick git not five hours ago.
I suppose.
I don't know.    She's smart. Funny.   Attractive...
You know.    She's... got nice skin.
Well
I've never really thought about it.      But I suppose
I think I'll be going to sleep now.
What?
Sorry
I think I'll be going.
The shelf
I don't really know how to answer that
Did Voldemort ever make the shelf
You knew him
What was he like?
I'm sorry
Have it your way.     Juice?
Dunno what you're talking about.
Yep.    Apparently it's his lucky day.
Yeah.    I suppose I could've just used
Ah.    Well... they're really good.
It feels like this.
Have you?
I just thought
So who are you taking?
Really...?
But I am the Chosen One.
Okay.    Kidding.   I'll just ask someone I like.   Someone cool.
Neville...?
What're you doing?
And what's happened to you?
Cormac!   That's who you invited!
I think she went to powder her nose.
Dragon balls.
I think I should rejoin the party
A message...?
Traveling?    Where?
Positive.    Why?
I'd worked that much out for myself
Lovely.
I'll take your word for it.
So what happens?     If you break an Unbreakable Vow?
Draco's plotting something
I know it sounds mad --
That's not what it sounded like.
But Dumbledore can make mistakes. He's said it himself --
I'm not --
It's good.
Are you alright
Did you get my owl?
Go on.
A Vanishing Cabinet?
What happened to it?     The one at Borgin & Burkes?
Soon.
I know who I am
If Dumbledore's traveling places
You tell me.
Who could tell the difference?
I don't understand -- what happened?
But why would he tamper with his own memory?
Why?
I don't know him that well
Well
Well
I'm not sure... That is
Yes
Did you say the same to Tom Riddle
Sir --
Nice.
Hermione.    I think Malfoy's leaving the castle.
I've seen it.    Sometimes... sometimes he just disappears off
the Map.
The Map is never wrong.
Divine.   Had ourselves a little late-night snack
Or twenty.
Really?   Honestly
Excuse me?
Well... Brilliant.
Bloody well hope so.      She's been snogging you for three
months.
Who're you talking about?
Okay.    Very funny.
What the hell was that for?
Okay!    Fine!    You're in love with her!   Have you ever actually
met her!
Ron
Devastatingly handsome.
Sir.    I'm sorry.    I wouldn't bother you if it weren't
absolutely --
I figured this called for a more practiced hand
I'm sorry
I mean
Yes
Love potion.
Ron!    Ron!!!    Professor
Professor!      Do something!!
He's choking!!
Breathe!    C'mon
How are you
Sectumsempra!
The Room of Requirement...
Who showed you this?      First.
What?
Oh.    Yeah.
Say that again.
Excellent.      Really excellent.
Right.    I'm going down to Hagrid's.
No. I've got a good feeling about going to Hagrid's.        I feel
like it's the place to be tonight
Trust me.      I know what I'm doing. Or at least Felix does.
Sorry
Just the general behavior
Personally
Through the front doors
Sir?
Well
That would be counterproductive
No idea.
A dead one
Not to mention the pincers.
Through the front doors.
Oh yeah.
Do you know why I survived?      The night I got this.
Because of her. Because she sacrificed herself. Because she
refused to step aside. Because her love was more powerful than Voldemort.
I'm not afraid of the name
Professor.    I'm going to tell you something
Only I can kill him.    But in order to do so
Be brave
Sir --
Do you mean to say he succeeded
Seven. He made seven -- the most powerfully magical number.
But... what are they exactly?
Tom Riddle's diary --
And the ring...?
... even more difficult to destroy. But if you could find them
all. If you did destroy each Horcrux...
But how would you find them?      They could be hidden anywhere
It's where you've been going
Hermione
It would explain why I thought Malfoy was leaving the castle
when he disappeared off the Map.
He was going to the Room of Requirement.
But I'm telling you.    I saw it --
What if there are two?    Vanishing cabinets.
I don't know...
I don't need luck.    I'll be with Dumbledore.
You look the same to me
Yes
My word.
Sir
It's there
Sir!
You should've let me
We couldn't
Accio Horcrux!
Sir... have you ever taken Felix Felicis?
Professor... there are bodies in this lake.
Do you think the Horcrux is in there
Why can't I drink it
Professor?
Professor?    Can you hear me?
You... you can't stop
It will
What?
No...
One more.    Just one more.   And then -- I promise... I'll do
what you say.
I promise.
You did it
I'm trying
Don't worry
We need to get you up to the hospital
All right.    Okay.
Sir
Cruciatus!
Incacerata!
Impedimenta!
Fight!    Fight back
Sectumsempra!
Hagrid... HAGRID!
Hagrid!    You alright?
Hagrid
Do you think he would've done it. Draco?
No.    He was lowering his wand.    In the end
Yeah
Go on.    Open it.
Dunno.    But whoever they are
I'm not coming back
I have to finish what Dumbledore started. I'm not sure where
that will lead me... but I'll let you and Ron konw where I am -- when I can.
Yeah. I do.     But do me a favor. When I'm around?    Keep the
snogging to a minimum.
Funny
You're brilliant.      You both are.
I donâ€™t know. I never realised how beautiful this place was.
Time for the teary farewell.
They'll torture you.      Even Dudley. If they think you know
where I'm going
Do you have any?      Magic?
Absolutely not.      Besides
Well... thanks.
See you
Good riddance.
I thought you were looking after the Prime Minister
The Trace?
The real one...?
No!    Absolutely not!
If you think I'm going to let people risk their lives for me
--
This is different.      Taking that. Becoming me -- no.
Blimey
Yes?
Here.
Hagrid!    We've got to help the others!
What was that?
Hagrid... HAGRID...!
Is no one back yet?
Are you mad...?
A grindylow!
Who did this to him?
Hedwig -- I think.      She was trying to protect me --
I trust you with my life
No one else is going to die.      Not for me.
Come with me.    Now.
Wedding?
I don't care about a bloody wedding -- no matter whose it is.
I have to start searching for the Horcruxes. It's the only chance we have to
beat him. And the longer we wait the stronger he gets.
Yes.
Dumbledore didn't want anyone to know what it is we're doing.
If I tell you
Maybe that's the best reason to have it.        Because of
everything that's going on.
To what do we owe the pleasure
And this would be...?
What's this all about?
No idea.
That's it then?
Excuse me?
You'll forgive me
You mean -- But that's brilliant -- I... don't know what to
say.
No
Nice to meet you
Sir?    May I sit down?
I found what you wrote in the Daily Prophet very moving
I never even knew he had a brother
Sir
Strange
Could you tell me from where they'd come
Just curious.    I was... close to Professor Dumbledore.
Who are you talking about?
Who?
Oh
Godric's Hollow?    Bathilda Bagshot lives in Godric's Hollow?
Excuse me?    You don't mean to say Dumbledore lived there too?
Do you reckon everyone's alright at the wedding?        Maybe we
should --
Same.
My rucksack.    With all my things. I left it back at the Burrow
--
You're joking.
Down!
Stupefy!
Lock the door
This one's name is Rowle.     He was on the Astronomy Tower the
night Snape killed Dumbledore.
It's better we wipe their memories.     We kill them
How is it they knew we were there?
Hermione. I appreciate the thought -- honestly. But given
that we were almost killed by a couple of Death Eaters a few minutes ago...
I have an idea.
Mad-Eye...?
Lumos.
Yeah.    They knew her.   She wrote A History of Magic
I'm thinking maybe we should go talk to her.     She still lives
in Godric's Hollow. I'm thinking maybe she could help us.
To the Dark Lord. I know I will be dead long before you read
this... I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it...
Stop!    I order you!
Been spying on us
Ever seen this before?
Kreacher
That's right.    But there were two
Where's the other one?
Answer her.
How do you mean?
Where is it now?    Did someone take it
Who
Find him.
You mean... it remembers me?
When you turned this place over -- don't deny it! -- you found
a locket
Who was she?    This witch?
It gets really tricky.
This is completely mental.
I'm nobody.
Apparently so.
Are those...?
The Ministry must be hiring young these days.
How long did you say this batch of Polyjuice Potion would last
Ron.    You don't have a wife.
Look
Ron's been coming here since he was two years old.       It's us
you should be worrying about.
I say if we don't locate Umbridge within the hour
Accio locket.
Ron
She went down to the courtrooms with Umbridge --
Arthur!    You know you're being tracked
No
I'll tell you later.      Let's find Hermione.
It's here...
You're lying.    And one mustn't tell lies
Expecto PATRONUM!
Accio Dittany.
Hermione.    His arm --
What happened?    I thought we were going back to Grimmauld
Place.
Don't be stupid.
What're you doing?
Tent?    Where am I supposed to find --
They're great.
No problem.
How bad is he?
Dumbledore had a theory. He felt that the Horcruxes would not
be made out of random objects. And he felt they wouldn't be hidden randomly
either. We know of three so far. The ring
How d'you know?
I know.    I felt it too. It's... it's like it's ticking or
something
That's why we're going to kill it.
Dissendium!
Expulso!
We have to keep it safe until we can figure out how to destroy
it.
No.
It's not a candle I can blow out
He's found him.    Vol--
You-Know-Who.    He's found Gregorovitch --
Yes.    How'd you know?
You-Know-Who wants something Gregorovitch once had -- dunno
what. But he's desperate to have it. It's as if his life depends on it.
Well it sets my teeth on edge. What's he expecting to hear?
Good news?
And what gets you through the day?
How long before he can travel?
You're not doing enough.
Loads.
Snatchers.
Good to know your enchantments work.
We have to leave.    We're not safe here.
Then we'll go by foot.
We're all hungry.
It'll be dark soon.    We need to find a place to sleep.
My turn.
Maybe you could tell me now.
Brilliant.
O-kay.
With a basilisk fang. If you tell me you've got one of those
in that bloody beaded bag of yours --
It only takes in that which makes it stronger...
... it can destroy Horcruxes.
You're brilliant
There's only one problem...
What's the problem?
Look
I thought you knew what you signed up for.
I don't understand. What part of this isn't living up to your
expectations? Did you think we'd be staying in five-star hotels? Finding a
Horcrux every other day? Did you think you'd be back to Mummy by Christmas?
I've told you everything Dumbledore told me! And in case you
haven't noticed
Yeah
You think I don't listen!     You think I don't know what it's
like --
Go then.    But leave that.
Salvio Hexia... Protego Totalum...
You were right. It's like you said. Snitches have flesh
memories. But I didn't catch my first Snitch with my hand. I almost
swallowed it.
What do you reckon it means?
Luna's dad was wearing that
Around his neck. Like an amulet. I didn't think much of it at
the time. You know Luna -- she's always got some mad thing or the other
she's carrying around. I just figured it ran in the family.
Hermione
But it means something to him too
Godric's Hollow is the birthplace of Godric Gryffindor -- I
mean
Tossed it at Neville once when he was snoring -- might've
popped open.
Hermione...
No.    This is where I was born. I'm not returning as someone
else.
Do you think they'd be in there? My mum and dad?
Is it -- ?
No.
Happy Christmas
Yeah.
C'mon.
We look like ordinary Muggles.
Relax.    This is right.   I know it.
This is where they died
You're Bathilda
Hermione
She's gaga
Here.    Let me do that.
Miss Bagshot?    Who is this man?
His name.    Can you tell me his name?
This is him
She wants us to go upstairs.
She wants me to go.      Alone.
It's all right.     You stay here.
Lumos.
Yes.
Yes.
We got away.
Are you alright?
You've outdone yourself this time.
Where are they?
Who is he
Well?
Tell me
Hermione
Get to the hard part
And Dumbledore believed in it?
'For the Greater Good.'       What does that mean?
We're young
Where's my wand?     I'll take the watch.
Hermione.    Where's my wand?
It's done.
It's done.
Leave me yours.     You get back in the warm.    And give me that.
No...
Lumos! Accio Sword.
Diffindo.
Hermione...
It was you!
And the doe.    That was you as well.
My Patronus is a stag.
You didn't see anyone else?
But I reckon whoever cast the doe
See that?    It knows.     It's afraid. Do it.
All the more reason.
Then why are you here?       Why did you come back?
I'll have to speak to it in order for it to open.       When it
does
On three.    One.   Two.    Three. Take me inside...
Stab it
Don't listen to it.
Ron.    Don't listen to it!
Ron.    Stab it!
We were better without you
Ron.    It lies!   Stab it!   STAB IT!
Your mother confessed that she would have preferred me as a
son...
Do it
After you left
You've sort of made up for it tonight.     Getting the sword.
Finishing off the Horcrux.
That too.
Hermione!
Fine.    Actually... more than fine.
Um... I don't know?
It's a long story.
It's a long story.
Exactly how did you find us?
It?
Knew what?
Keep talking 'bout that little ball of light touching your
heart -- she'll come round.
Yeah...
Engorgio.
Reducio!
Nothing.
Sorry?
Jesus.    It was there too.
Outside Gregorovitch's wand shop. on the alley wall...
Not still mad at him
Luna.
Hello
Would it be okay if we came in? It won't take long
Well
What's going on here?
Well
Yes!    Exactly.   What we wondered
The what?
No.
Sorry... I still don't really understand...
Which one would you choose if you could?     Of the Deathly
Hallows?
The Stone.
Well
But I have one.     The Invisibility Cloak my father left me.
And I think I've actually held the Resurrection Stone in my
hands
Sir?
Who took her
They've kidnapped Luna because he supported me.   He was just
desperate.
They exist.    The Hallows.
But he only wants the one
He knows where it is
Dudely.    Vernon Dudley.
The list is wrong.    I told you who I am --
What did you put on me?
How long will it last?
Luna?
Help us.
Dobby? What are you doing here?
You can Apparate in and out of this room? Could you take us
with you?
Dobby
Stupefy.
Stupefy!
Hermione. You're all right. We're safe. We're all safe.
Dobby. Dobby. No
I want to bury him. Properly. Without magic.
I need to talk to the goblin.
How are you?
You probably don't remember --
Yes.
Why did you leave Gringotts?
Alone
It's complicated. Why did Bellatrix Lestrange think it should
be in her vault at Gringotts?
The sword presented itself to us in a moment of need. We
didn't steal it.
And she never suspected?
And in Madam Lestrange's vault as well?
Then what? The goblin twists the curl at his chin... then his
eyes
She was terrified when she thought we'd been in there. She
kept asking you what else we'd taken. I'd bet anything there's a Horcrux
there. If we find it
I'm still working on that part.
Mr. Ollivander
Can you identify these
And this?
Was? Isn't it still?
What do you know about the Deathly Hallows
But you
You're lying. You know one exists and you told him about it.
You told him about the Elder Wand and where to go looking for it.
He has found it
That's all
Then I guess I'll just have to kill him before he finds me
I reckon you should take this then.
If I can hold it
I'll know. I can't explain. It's like...
No. I just know. When one's near.
In the morning.
He'll be leaving too.
Yeah. Funny. Listen
Hogwarts?
It's not the place you left
Wouldn't know you if I didn't know you.
Sirius gave it to me. He had a matching piece. He said if I
ever needed him
Something like that. I don't know. He died before I ever got
to use it. The thing is...
You'll think I'm mental
You can give that to Hermione to hold
C'mon. Let's do it.
Imperio.
How long before they come after us?
What is that
Griphook! What is that!
Well done. Hey.
Lumos !
That's it. Up there.
Give me the sword! The real one.
We have a deal
Griphook! Griphook!
Come on!
We're dropping!
He knows.
I saw him.
I can't always help it
He's angry. But he's scared too. He's going to make sure the
other Horcruxes are safe.
I reckon he'll do anything to stop us from finding the rest.
There's more: one of them's at Hogwarts.
Honestly
We'll go to Hogsmeade. To Honeydukes. Take the secret passage
in the cellar.
There's something wrong with him. In the past
No. It's more like he's wounded. If anything
Expecto Patronum!
You're Aberforth.
Dumbledore's brother. It's you I've been seeing -- here. It's
He's dead.
Dung had no right selling you that. It belonged to --
We need to get into Hogwarts. Dumbledore gave us a job to do.
We've been hunting Horcruxes. We think the last one's in the
school. But we'll need your help getting in.
If we can find it and kill it
Dumbledore trusted me
Why should he...
I only care about the Dumbledore I knew. I trusted him.
I had no reason not to â€”-
You're drunk.
Where've you sent her?
Neville
The Carrows?
Okay. There's something we need to find
We don't know.
I realize it's not much to go on.
I think it might have something to do with Ravenclaw. It would
be small
Hey there. Ron smiles
I think I can help you out with that... -.. Harry appears.
And I'm afraid it's rather extensive.
How dare you stand where he stood.
Tell them how it was that night. Tell then how you looked him
in the eye
I'm a Gryffindor.
Time. As much as you can give me.
Is that possible
I think you're right.
You
Okay. But take this. That way you can find me when you get
back.
Ravenclaw Common Room. Got to start somewhere. Hermione nods
I'm a bit preoccupied right now
We'll talk later
Later.
Okay
It's you...
You're the Grey Lady
I'm sorry. It's Helena
Yes. She thought you might be able to help me.
Yes! That's right --
Wait! Please!
But I don't care about its powers! Honestly --
I don't seek it for myself! You have to believe me!
I want to destroy it.
That's what you want
I'll end your pain
Tom Riddle --
He's lied to many people --
Thank you... -.. then turning...
Thank you... -.. then running.
Ginny! Neville! You alright?
Luna -- ?
I could ask you the same.
I remember.
What's wrong with the one you have?
Why didn't you tell her?
Bellatrix. You knew it was me. But you didn't say anything.
No. I don't think so...
Besides
Expelliarmus!
Well done. Let's find Ron and get out of here.
Split up!
No
Here! Take one!
Wait! What about Malfoy and Blaise!
Ron
He does.
It's the snake. She's the last one. The last Horcrux.
No. He'll keep her close.
I know where he is.
Give me something! Quickly! A flask! Anything.
I'm going there now.
It's... meant to be.
There's a reason I can... hear them -- the Horcruxes.
I think I've known for awhile.
Kill the snake. Kill the snake and then it's just him. Then it
will be over.
Why are you here? All of you?
Does it hurt? Dying?
I'm sorry. I didn't want any of you to die for me. And Remus
You'll stay with me?
He won't be able to see you?
Stay close to me.
You weren't.
Sir
Then... I'm dead too?
Not?
But I didn't defend myself. I let him kill me.
It's true
And you knew this? That's why you were certain I wouldn't die?
Professor
Exactly where are we
It looks like King's Cross station -- only a lot cleaner. And
without the trains.
Sir
Sir --
You wanted to see Ariana again
I used the Stone as well
I've got to go back
I've got a choice?
And where would it take me?
Voldemort's got the Elder Wand.
And the snake lives.
And I've nothing to kill it with.
With all due respect
Which would be
Sir
Professor.
Is this real? Or has this been happening inside my head?
Confringo!
The snake! We've got to kill the snake!
Because I have something worth living for.
Confringo!
You were right.
When you told Professor Snape it was failing you. It will
always fail you.
Together.
I told you: it's useless to you.
Because it answers to another.
When he killed Snape
It answers to me.
Well
Together?
There's nothing scary about thestrals. They're gentle things.
Anyway
Yes?
Albus Severus Potter. You were named after two Headmasters of
Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin. And he was probably the bravest man I
ever knew.
Then Slytherin House will have gained a wonderful wizard. But
listen
Really.
Ready?
