I feel like you're driving me to a court-martial. This is crazy. What did I do? I feel like you're going to pull over and snuff me. What, you're not allowed to talk? Hey, Forrest!
Oh, I see. So it's personal?
Good God, you're a woman. I honestly... I couldn't have called that. I mean, I'd apologize, but isn't that what we're going for here? I thought of you as a soldier first.
Well you have, actually, excellent bone structure, there. I'm kind of having a hard time not looking at you now. Is that weird? Come on, it's okay, laugh.
Yes, please.
That is an excellent question. Yes and no. March and I had a scheduling conflict, but fortunately, the Christmas cover was twins. Anything else? You're kidding me with the hand up, right?
Yes. It's very cool. Please, no gang signs. No, throw it up. I'm kidding. Yeah, peace. I love peace. I'd be out of a job with peace.
What's going on?
What have we got?
Yeah.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Give me a gun!
Whoa!
Work it! Come on! We should just stay till the morning.
Oh, no! Did they rope you into this?
I'm so sorry.
Of course I'd be deeply honored. And it's you, that's great. So, when do we do it?
There it is. That was easy. I'm so sorry.
Wow! Would you look at that? That's something else. I don't have any of those floating around. Uh, we're gonna let it ride! Give me a hand, will you? Give me a little something-something.
Come on, honey bear.
There it is. Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes rolls! And...
Worse things have happened. I think we're gonna be fine. Color me up, will ya?
All right.
Yeah, you can count on it.
I know, I know. Render unto Caesar, that which is Caesar's. There you go.}
She's all right? Hi.
Yeah. Okay--
Go.
Absolutely ridiculous. I don't paint.
That's not bad. Let me guess. Berkeley?
Well, Ms. Brown. It's an imperfect world, but it's the only one we've got. I guarantee you, the day weapons are no longer needed to keep the peace, I'll start making bricks and beams for baby hospitals.
Every night in front of the mirror before bedtime.
I'd like to show you first-hand.
Okay, here's serious. My old man had a philosophy, "Peace means having a bigger stick than the other guy."
My father helped defeat the Nazis. He worked on the Manhattan Project. A lot of people, including your professors at Brown, would call that being a hero.
Tell me, do you plan to report on the millions we've saved by advancing medical technology or kept from starvation with our intelli-crops? All those breakthroughs, military funding, honey.
I'd be prepared to lose a few with you.
Give me an exploded view.
Log that.
Please don't turn down my music.
How'd she take it?
Why are you trying to hustle me out of here?
That's funny, I thought with it being my plane and all, that it would just wait for me to get there.
I mean, doesn't it kind of defeat the whole purpose of having your own plane if it departs before you arrive?
Is it a good representation of his spring period?
So?
I need it. Buy it. Store it.
Is in June. Please, don't harangue me about stuff that's way, way, down...
Deflect it and absorb it. Don't transmit it back to me.
What are you trying to get rid of me for? What, you got plans?
I don't like it when you have plans.
It's your birthday?
I knew that. Already?
Well, get yourself something nice from me.
And?
Yeah.
You're welcome, Miss Potts... Okay.
You're good. I thought I lost you back there.
I got you. I got you.
What?
I got caught doing a piece for Vanity Fair.
Waiting on you now. Let's go. Come on. Wheels up! Rock and roll!
What you reading, platypus?
Come on, sour patch.
Don't be mad.
I said I was sorry.
I told you I was sorry.
Hi. I told him I was sorry, but he...
I respect you.
Hey! Heat up the sake, will you? Thanks for reminding me.
You can't have sashimi without sake.
It would be irresponsible not to drink. I'm just talking about a nightcap.
Yes, two, please.
Hey, you know what? I'm not like you. I'm not cut out...
Can you excuse me if I'm a bit distracted here?
General.
Thanks.
Is it better to be feared or respected? I say, is it too much to ask for both? With that in mind, I humbly present the crown jewel of Stark Industries' Freedom Line. It's the first missile system to incorporate our proprietary repulsor technology. They say the best weapon is one you never have to fire. I respectfully disagree. I prefer the weapon you only have to fire once. That's how Dad did it. That's how America does it. And it's worked out pretty well so far. Find an excuse to let one of these off the chain, and I personally guarantee you the bad guys won't even want to come out of their caves.
Tony Stark:
Obie, what are you doing up?
It went great. Looks like it's gonna be an early Christmas.
Why aren't you wearing those pajamas I got you?
I'm sorry, this is the "fun-vee." The "hum-drum-vee" is back there.
See you back at base.
What the hell did you do to me?
What is this?
I don't remember.
Where are we?
Those are my guns. How did they get my guns?
I refuse.
I think you got a lot of my weapons.
No, he won't.
Why should I do anything? They're going to kill me, you, either way. And if they don't, I'll probably be dead in a week.
How many languages do you speak?
Who are these people?
Uh-huh. Okay, we don't need this.
That's palladium, 0.15 grams. We need at least 1.6, so why don't you go break down the other 11?
Careful. Careful, we only get one shot at this.
What do I call you?
Yinsen. Nice to meet you.
That's because it's a miniaturized arc reactor. I got a big one powering my factory at home. It should keep the shrapnel out of my heart.
If my math is right, and it always is, three gigajoules per second.
Yeah. Or something big for 15 minutes.
This is our ticket out of here.
Flatten them out and look.
You still haven't told me where you're from.
Got a family?
No.
What does he want?
What do you want? A delivery date? I need him. Good assistant.
41 steps straight ahead. Then 16 steps, that's from the door, fork right, 33 steps, turn right.
Say something. Say something back to him.
Then speak Hungarian.
What do you know?
How'd that work?
That's what I do.
Initialize the power sequence.
Now!
Function 11. Tell me when you see a progress bar. It should be up right now.
Talk to me. Tell me when you see it.
Press Control "l".
"I." "Enter."
"l" and "Enter." Come over here and button me up.
Every other hex bolt.
Nothing pretty, just get it done. Just get it done.
Make sure the checkpoints are clear before you follow me out, okay?
Stick to the plan! Stick to the plan! Yinsen! Yinsen!
Yinsen!
Come on. We got to go. Move for me, come on. We got a plan. We're gonna stick to it.
Come on, you're gonna go see your family. Get up.
Thank you for saving me.
My turn. Not bad.
Hey! Hey!
Are you kidding me with this? Get rid of them. Your eyes are red. A few tears for your long-lost boss?
Yeah, vacation's over.
No.
No is a complete answer.
I don't have to do anything. I've been in captivity for three months. There are two things I want to do. I want an American cheeseburger, and the other...
...is not what you think. I want you to call for a press conference now.
Yeah.
Hogan, drive. Cheeseburger first.
No, I'm fine.
Well, come on.
There's only one left. I need it.
Hey, would it be all right if everyone sat down?
Good to see you.
I never got to say goodbye to Dad. I never got to say goodbye to my father. There's questions that I would have asked him. I would have asked him how he felt about what this company did. If he was conflicted, if he ever had doubts. Or maybe he was every inch the man we all remember from the newsreels. I saw young Americans killed by the very weapons I created to defend them and protect them. And I saw that I had become part of a system that is comfortable with zero accountability.
Hey, Ben.
I had my eyes opened. until such a time as I can decide what the future of the company will be.
What direction it should take, one that I'm comfortable with and is consistent with the highest good for this country, as well.
Did I just paint a target on the back of my head?
Uh, optimistically, 40 points.
Yep.
Obie, I just don't want a body count to be our only legacy.
It's my name on the side of the building.
Not based on what I saw. We're not doing a good enough job. We can do better. We're gonna do something else.
I think we should take another look into arc reactor technology.
It works.
Maybe.
That's what they say. Could you have a lousier poker face? Just tell me, who told you?
It's Rhodey or Pepper.
Okay, Rhodey.
Okay? It works.
I'm sorry I didn't give you a heads-up, okay? But if I had...
That was Dad's line.
Pepper. How big are your hands?
How big are your hands?
Get down here. I need you. Oh, wow. They are small. Very petite, indeed. I just uh.. need your help for a sec.
It was. It is now an antique. This is what will be keeping me alive for the foreseeable future. I'm swapping it up for an upgraded unit, and I just ran into a little speed bump.
It's nothing. It's just a little snag. There's an exposed wire under this device. And it's contacting the socket wall and causing a little bit of a short. It's fine.
Put that on the table over there. That is irrelevant.
I want you to reach in, and you're just gonna gently lift the wire out.
Yeah, it should be fine. It's like Operation. You just don't let it touch the socket wall or it goes "beep."
It's just a game, never mind. Just gently lift the wire.
Okay? Great.
No, you're fine. You're the most capable, qualified, trustworthy person I've ever met. You're gonna do great. Is it too much of a problem to ask? 'Cause I'm...
I really need your help here.
It's not pus. It's an inorganic plasmic discharge from the device, not from my body.
Yeah, it does. The copper wire. The copper wire, you got it?
Okay, you got it? Now, don't let it touch the sides when you're coming out!
That's what I was trying to tell you before. Okay, now make sure that when you pull it out, that you don't... There's a magnet at the end of it! That was it. You just pulled it out.
Okay, I was not expecting...
Don't put it back in! Don't put it back in!
Nothing, I'm just going into cardiac arrest--
'cause you yanked it out like a trout... We gotta hurry. Take this. Take this. You gotta switch it out really quick.
What?
Is it?
Let's hope. Okay, you're gonna attach that to the base plate. Make s-sure you... Was that so hard? That was fun, right? Here, I got it. I got it. Here. Nice.
Yeah, I feel great. You okay?
I don't have anyone but you. Anyway...
That? Destroy it. Incinerate it.
Pepper, I've been called many things. "Nostalgic" is not one of them.
That will be all, Miss Potts. Hey, Butterfingers, come here. What's all this stuff doing on top of my desk? That's my phone, that's a picture of me and my dad. Right there. In the garbage. All that stuff.
Colonel? Why not a pilot without the plane?
Speaking of manned or unmanned, you gotta get him to tell you about the time he guessed wrong at spring break. Just remember that, spring break, 1987. That lovely lady you woke up with.
What was his name?
Was it Ivan?
Okay.
Okay.
Pleasure meeting you.
Why?
I'm doing a little better than walking.
Yeah. Rhodey, I'm working on something big. I came to talk to you. I want you to be a part of it.
This is not for the military. I'm not... It's different.
I need you to listen to me.
Okay.
Thanks.
JARVIS, you up?
I'd like to open a new project file, index as Mark Two.
Actually, I don't know who to trust right now. Till further notice, why don't we just keep everything on my private server?
I don't want this winding up in the wrong hands. Maybe in mine, it can actually do some good.
Next. Up. Not in the boot, Dummy. Right here. You got me? Stay put. Nice. You're of no benefit at all. Move down to the toe. I got this. Okay, I'm sorry, am I in your way? Up. Screw it. Don't even move. You are a tragedy.
Okay, let's do this right. Start mark, half a meter, and back and center. Dummy, look alive. You're on standby for fire safety. You, roll it. Okay. Activate hand controls. We're gonna start off nice and easy. We're gonna see if 10% thrust capacity achieves lift. And three, two, one.
Up two. All right, set that.
Yeah, everything's... What?
Great!
Great. I'll be right up.
It is. This is a flight stabilizer. It's completely harmless. How'd it go? It went that bad, huh?
Sure doesn't. Oh, boy.
Uh-huh. You told me to lay low. That's what I've been doing. I lay low, and you take care of all...
This was a board of directors meeting?
A what?
Why, 'cause the stocks dipped 40 points? We knew that was gonna happen.
It doesn't matter. We own the controlling interest in the company.
I'm being responsible! That's a new direction for me, for the company. I mean, me on the company's behalf being responsible for the way that... This is great.
I'll be in the shop.
No. No, absolutely not.
This one stays with me. That's it, Obie. Forget it.
Thank you.
Good night, Obie.
No! Uh-uh! Uh-uh! Yeah, I can fly.
JARVIS, are you there?
Engage heads-up display.
Import all preferences from home interface.
All right, what do you say?
Can we start the virtual walk-around?
Do a check on control surfaces
Uh, yeah. Tell you what. Do a weather and ATC check. Start listening in on ground control.
JARVIS! Sometimes you got to run before you can walk. Ready? In three, two, one. Handles like a dream. All right, let's see what this thing can do. What's SR-71's record?
Records are made to be broken! Come on!
Keep going! Higher! We iced up, JARVIS! Deploy flaps! JARVIS! Come on, we got to break the ice!
Kill power.
Notes. Main transducer feels sluggish at plus 40 altitude. Hull pressurization is problematic. I'm thinking icing is the probable factor.
Connect to the sys. co. Have it reconfigure the shell metals. Use the gold titanium alloy from the seraphim tactical satellite. That should ensure a fuselage integrity while maintaining power-to-weight ratio. Got it?
Thrill me.
JARVIS, we get an invite for that?
A little ostentatious, don't you think?
Tell you what. Throw a little hot-rod red in there.
Hey, I like it. Fabricate it. Paint it.
Don't wait up for me, honey.
Sure don't. You look great, Hef.
What's the world coming to when a guy's got to crash his own party?
I'll see you inside.
You got it. Just cabin fever. I'll just be a minute. Give me a Scotch. I'm starving.
Yeah?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. The guy from the..
God, you need a new name for that.
Let's just put something on the books.
Tell you what. You got it. You're absolutely right. Well, I'm going to go to my assistant, and we'll make a date. You look fantastic! I didn't recognize you.
Just avoiding government agents.
Yes. Where'd you get that dress?
That's great.
Well, I got great taste.
You want to dance?
All right, come on.
Am I making you uncomfortable?
You look great and you smell great.
But I could fire you if that would take the edge off.
I'd make it a week. Sure.
Five.
Right.
The other eight? So, I got you for the other eight. How about a little air?
Totally harmless.
We're dancing. No one's even watching.
I think you lost objectivity. I think they just... People... We just danced.
I don't think it was taken that way.
I just think you're overstating it.
Got it, okay.
Okay.
Two vodka martinis, extra dry, extra olives, extra fast. Make one of them dirty, will you?
Oh, hey.
Carrie.
That's right.
Panic. I would say panic is my reaction.
Yeah. They just put my name on the invitation. I don't know what to tell you.
I was out of town for a couple months, in case you didn't hear.
When were these taken?
I didn't approve any shipment.
Well, I'm not my company.
Have you seen these pictures? What's going on in Gulmira?
You know what? I was naive before, when they said, "Here's the line. We don't cross it. This is how we do business." If we're double-dealing under the table... Are we?
He's all yours.
Hello?
Who's this?
Sorry, hello?
Speak up, please.
Oh, yeah, I'm driving with the top down.
It's funny how that works, huh?
Well, that's a hot spot. Sounds like someone stepped in and did your job for you, huh?
I'm not, I was just jogging in the canyon.
Right, I was driving to the canyon, where I'm going to jog.
Nope!
That's my exit.
Hit it.
Flares!
Deploy flaps!
Hi, Rhodey, it's me.
I'm sorry, it is me. You asked. What you were asking about is me.
This is not a piece of equipment. I'm in it. It's a suit. It's me!
Hey, thanks.
Yeah, well, technically, he hit me. Now are you going to come by and see what I'm working on?
Training exercise. Isn't that the usual BS?
Hey!
Be gentle. This is my first time. I designed this to come off, so... Hey. I really should be able to...
Let's face it. This is not the worst thing you've caught me doing.
Hey. You busy? You mind if I send you on an errand? I need you to go to my office. You're going to hack into the mainframe and you're going to retrieve all the recent shipping manifests. This is a lock chip. This'll get you in. It's probably under Executive Files. If not, they put it on a ghost drive, in which case you need to look for the lowest numeric heading.
Same drill. They've been dealing under the table, and I'm going to stop them. I'm going to find my weapons and destroy them.
There is nothing except this. There's no art opening. There is no benefit. There is nothing to sign. There is the next mission and nothing else.
You stood by my side all these years while I reaped the benefits of destruction. And now that I'm trying to protect the people that I put in harm's way, you're going to walk out?
I shouldn't be alive, unless it was for a reason. I'm not crazy, Pepper. I just finally know what I have to do. And I know in my heart that it's right.
Good boy.
Where's Pepper?
That's not going to be enough.
Not bad, huh? Let's do it.
Keep the skies clear.
How do you think the Mark One chest piece is going to hold up?
Keep me posted. Pepper!
I'm fine. How are...
I know. Listen, you'd better get out of there.
Get out of there right now!
Stane!
Put them down!
Divert power to chest RT.
Lady! No, no, no, no, no, no!
Duly noted. Take me to maximum altitude.
I know the math! Do it!
Climb!
Keep going!
Just leave it on the screen! Stop telling me!
How'd you solve the icing problem?
Might want to look into it.
Woah! Potts!
I'm almost out of power. I've got to get out of this thing. I'll be right there.
Weapons status?
Flares!
Potts?
This isn't working. We're going to have to overload the reactor and blast the roof.
You're going to do it. Go to the central console, open up all the circuits. When I get clear of the roof, I'll let you know. You're going to hit the master bypass button. It's going to fry everything up here.
Make sure you wait till I clear the roof. I'll buy you some time. This looks important!
Pepper!
Time to hit the button!
Just do it!
Push it!
"Iron Man." That's kind of catchy. It's got a nice ring to it. I mean, it's not technically accurate. The suit's a gold-titanium alloy, but it's kind of evocative, the imagery, anyway.
Okay?
Yeah.
See, I was thinking maybe we should say it was just Pepper and me alone on the island.
All right.
There's nothing about Stane here.
But what about the whole cover story that it's a bodyguard? He's my... I mean, is that... That's kind of flimsy, don't you think?
You know, it's actually not that bad. Even I don't think I'm Iron Man.
Am so.
All right, suit yourself. You know, if I were Iron Man, I'd have this girlfriend who knew my true identity. She'd be a wreck, 'cause she'd always be worrying that I was going to die, yet so proud of the man I'd become. She'd be wildly conflicted, which would only make her more crazy about me. Tell me you never think about that night.
You know.
Yes, that will be all, Miss Potts.
Thank you. Been a while since I was in front of you. I figure I'll stick to the cards this time. There's been speculation that I was involved in the events that occurred on the freeway and the rooftop...
I know that it's confusing. It is one thing to question the official story, and another thing entirely to make wild accusations, or insinuate that I'm a superhero.
Didn't? Well, good, because that would be outlandish and fantastic. I'm just not the hero type. Clearly. With this laundry list of character defects, all the mistakes I've made, largely public.
Yeah, okay. Yeah. The truth is... I am Iron Man.
Jarvis!
Who the hell are you?
Ah.
It’s good to be back. You missed me?
I missed you too. Blow something up? I already did that. I’m not saying that the world is enjoying its longest period of uninterrupted peace in years because of me. I’m not saying that from the ashes of captivity, never has a greater phoenix metaphor been personified in human history. I’m not saying that Uncle Sam can kick back on a lawn chair, sipping on an iced tea because I haven’t come across anyone who’s man enough to go toe-to-toe with me on my best day.
Please, it’s not about me. And now, making a special guest appearance from the great beyond to tell you what it’s all about, please welcome my father, Howard.
All right, it’s a zoo out there, watch out.
Hey, nice to see you. All right. Thank you. I remember you.
Hey, hey.
Hello. It would be a pleasure.
See you buddy.
Hey, the oracle of Oracle. What a pleasure. Nice to see you.
Larry! Larry. Yes, my people, my people.
Very mellow.
No, it was perfect.
Hey, does she come with the car?
Hi. And you are?
Irish. I like it.
I’m on the wheel. Do you mind? Where you from?
What are you doing here?
Yeah? You found me. What are you up to later?
Yikes.
Yeah, I have a peeve.
Can I see a badge?
Yep. How far are we from D.C.?
Yes dear?
Absolutely.
I do not.
I do not. Well, it depends on how you define the word weapon.
My device does not fit that description.
I would describe it by defining it as what it is, Senator.
It’s a high-tech prosthesis. That is… That is… That’s actually the most apt description I can make of it.
Please, if your priority was actually the well-being of the American citizen…
Well, you can forget it. I am Iron Man. The suit and I are one. To turn over the Iron Man suit would be to turn over myself which is tantamount to indentured servitude or prostitution, depending or what state you’re in. You can’t have it.
In prostitution? Of course not. You’re a senator. Come on.
Let the record reflect that I observed Mr Hammer entering the chamber, and I am wondering if and when any actual expert will also be in attendance.
Rhodey? What?
Hey, buddy. I didn’t expect to see you here.
I just…
All right, I’ll drop it.
I’m not a joiner, but I’ll consider Secretary of Defence, if you ask nice.
We can amend the hours a little bit.
Hold on a second buddy. Let me see something here. Boy, I’m good. I commandeered your screens. I need them. Time for a little transparency. Now, let’s see what’s really going on.
If you will direct your attention to said screens, I believe that’s North Korea.
Iran.
No grave threat here. Is that Justin Hammer? How did Hammer get in the game?
Justin, you’re on TV. Focus up.
Wow. Yeah, I’d say most countries, five, ten years away. Hammer Industries, twenty.
The point is, you’re welcome, I guess
Because I’m your nuclear deterrent. It’s working. We’re safe. America is secure. You want my property? You can’t have it. But I did you a big favour.
I’ve successfully privatised world peace.
What more do you want? For now! I tried to play ball with these ass-clowns.
Okay.
Wake up, Daddy’s home.
You!
I swear to God I’ll dismantle you. I’ll soak your motherboard. I’ll turn you into a wine rack.
How many ounce a day of this gobbledegook am I supposed to drink?
Check palladium levels.
God, they’re running out quick.
Mute.
What?
Hey, I’m thinking I’m busy. And you’re angry about something. Do you have the sniffles? I don’t want to get sick.
Keep your business.
Boy Scouts of America.
Yes. It is a worthwhile organisation. I didn’t physically check the crates but, basically, yes. And it’s not “our” collection, it’s my collection. No offence.
It was a tax write-off. I needed that.
Dummy. Hey, stop spacing out. The Bridgeport’s already machining that part.
I need you to wear a surgical mask until you’re feeling better. Is that okay?
There’s nothing more important to me than the Expo. It’s my primary point of concern. I don’t know why you’re…
Wow. Look at that. That’s modern art. That’s going up.
I’m gonna put this up right now. This is vital.
No. Our stocks have never been higher.
You are… Well, if’s messy then let’s double back.
Let’s move onto another subject.
I’m not taking it down. I’m just replacing it with this.
Let’s see what I can get going on here.
Yeah. Don’t say “wind farm.” I’m already feeling gassy.
Everything was my idea.
I don’t care about the liberal agenda any more. It’s boring. Boring. I’m giving you a boring alert. You do it.
Excellent idea. I just figured this out. You run the company.
Pepper, I need you to run the company. Well, stop trying to do it and do it.
I’m not asking you to try…
I’m asking you to physically do it. I need you to do it.
Pepper, you’re not listening to me!
I’m trying to make you CEO. Why won’t you let me?
Chlorophyll. I hereby irrevocably appoint you chairman and CEO of Stark Industries effective immediately. Yeah, done deal. Okay? I’ve actually given this a fair amount of thought, believe it or not. Congratulations? Take it, just take it.
Don’t think, drink. There you go.
I’m on happy time. Sorry.
It’s called mixed martial arts. It’s been around for three weeks.
All right, put them up. Come on.
That’s it. I’m done. What’s your name, lady?
Front and centre. Come into the church.
If it pleases the court, which it does.
Can you give her a lesson?
Pepper.
Who is she?
I need a new assistant, boss.
I don’t have time to meet. I need someone now. I feel like it’s her.
How do I spell your name, Natalie?
I thought I was ogling her. Wow. Very, very impressive individual.
She’s fluent in French, Italian, Russian, Latin. Who speaks Latin?
No one speaks Latin
Did you model in Tokyo? ‘Cause she modelled in Tokyo.
I need her. She’s got everything that I need.
That’s what I’m talking about.
You did?
Looks like a TKO to me.
You have a quiet reserve. I don’t know, you have an old soul.
Right.
Great. Just wrapping up here. Hey. You’re the boss.
No.
I want one.
You know, it’s Europe. Whatever happens the next 20 minutes, just go with it.
Hey.
It was excellent. Boy, it’s nice to see you.
What? You made me do it.
You quit. Smile. Look, right there. Stop acting constipated. Don’t flare your nostrils.
That’s the amazing thing.
You look fantastic.
But that’s unprofessional. What’s on the docket?
Perfect. I’ll be there at 11:00.
Is this us?
Great. Make it us.
Elon, how’s it going. Those Merlin engines are fantastic.
You do?
Then we’ll make it work. You want a massage?
I’ll have Natalie make an…
Don’t want you tense. By the way, I didn’t mean to spring this on you.
Green is not your best colour.
My least favourite person on Earth.
Justin Hammer.
Yes, roughly.
And she wrote a story as well.
That was good.
Don’t leave me.
I’m all right.
Please, this is tough.
God, that’s so awful.
Since he got his contract revoked…
…when you were attempting to…That’s not what I heard. What’s the difference between “hold and “cancelled”? The truth?
Well, if you invent something that works, I’ll make sure I get you a slot.
Yes?
Hammer needs a slot, Christine.
Got any other bad ideas?
…and owning a race car…
…if you don’t drive it?
Are you okay?
Were you heading from me or him?
‘Cause I can’t tell!
Better security.
I was attacked. We need better security.
You’re CEO. Better security measures. God, it’s embarrassing.
Hit him again. Hit him again. Football.
Give him the case!
Calm down.
Give me the case! Please! Come on!
Pretty decent tech. Cycles per second were a little low. You could have doubled up your rotations. You focused the repulsor energy through ionised plasma channels. It’s effective. Not very efficient. But it’s a passable knock-off. I don’t get it. A little fine tuning you could have made a solid pay check. You could have sold it to North Korea, China, Iran, or gone onto the black market. You look like you got friends in low places.
Speaking of thieves, where did you get this design?
Well, I never heard of him.
The reason I’m alive is ‘cause you had a shot, you took it, you missed.
Where will you be watching the world consume me from? That’s right. A prison cell. I’ll send you a bar of soap.
Mute. He should be giving me a medal. That’s the truth.
This is your in-flight meal.
Yeah. Where do you think I’ve been for three hours?
I don’t want to go home. At all. Let’s cancel my birthday party and… We’re in Europe. Let’s go to Venice, Cipriani. Remember?
It’s a great place to be healthy.
Yeah, but maybe that’s why it’s the best time. ‘Cause then we can…
As CEO, you are entitled to a leave.
A company retreat.
Just a ride. Well, I’m just saying, to recharge our batteries and figure it all out.
Let’s go.
Yeah, I should get to my desk. See that cigar box?
It’s palladium.
If you must know, it’s neutron damage. It’s from the reactor wall.
Road rash. Thank you. What are you looking at?
You know, I wish I could believe that. I really do. But you’ve gotta trust me. Contrary to popular belief, I know exactly what I’m doing.
I’ll give them a look. I should cancel the party.
Yeah. ‘Cause it’s…
Right, sends the wrong message.
Gold face, brown hand. The Jaeger. I’ll give that a look. Bring them over. I gotta say it. It’s hard to get a read on you. Where are you from?
Can I ask you a question, hypothetically? Bit odd. If this was your last birthday party you were ever gonna have, how would you celebrate it?
Tony:
I love you.
No, no, no, we can’t … Wait, wait, wait. We didn’t have the cake. We didn’t blow out the candles.
You’re out of control gorgeous.
Give me another smooch
Come on, you know you want to.
I know. It has a filtration system.
You could drink that water.
If you say so.
Pepper Potts. She’s right. The party’s over. Then again, the party was over for me, like, an hour and a half ago. The after-party starts in 15 minutes. And if anybody, Pepper, doesn’t like it, there’s the door. I think she wants the Gallagher!
Goldstein.
Give me a phat beat to beat my buddy’s ass to.
Now, put that thing back where you found it before someone gets hurt. Sorry, pal, but Iron Man doesn’t have a sidekick.
You want it? Take it!
You think you got what it takes to wear that suit?
You wanna be the War Machine, take your shot.
You gonna take a shot?
No!
Take it!
I told you I don’t wanna join your super-secret boy band.
It’s… It’s… It’s… I’m sorry. I don’t wanna get off on the wrong foot. Do I look at the patch or the eye? Honestly I’m a bit hung over. I’m not sure if you’re real of if I’m having…
Just my luck. Where’s the staff here?
I’ve been worse.
You’re fired.
Hi.
I suggest you apologise.
You don’t know better. I didn’t give it to him. He took it.
What do you want from me?
Oh, God, are gonna steal my kidney and sell it? Could you please not do anything awful for five seconds? What did she just do to me?
Give me a couple of boxes of that. I’ll be right as rain.
Trust me, I know. I’m good at this stuff. I’ve been looking for a suitable replacement for palladium. I’ve tried every combination, every permutation of every known element.
No, it was finished. It has never been particularly effective until I miniaturised it and put it in my…
Just him, or Anton Vanko in on this too?
You told me I hadn’t tried everything. What do you mean I haven’t tried everything? What haven’t I tried?
He said that?
I don’t know where you get your information, but he wasn’t my biggest fan.
He was cold, he was calculating. He never told me he loved me. He never even told me he liked me, so it’s a little tough for me to digest when you’re telling me he said the whole future was riding on me and he’s passing it down. I don’t get that. You’re talking about a guy who’s happiest day was when he shipped me off to boarding school.
Well, then, clearly you knew my dad better than I did.
What?
Wait, wait, wait, wait. What’s this?
No, I’m not good.
Got what? I don’t even know what I’m supposed to get.
Yeah.
Please. First thing, I need a little bodywork. I’ll put in a little time at the lab. If we could send one of your goon squad down to The Coffee Bean, Cross Creek, for a Starbucks run, or something like that, that’d be nice.
I think I got it, yeah.
I don’t have any dough. Here.
No, it’s fine. Take that. It’s fine
Take it. Take it. I don’t like people handing me things. If you just drop that there, that’d be great.
Sometimes.
Relax.
Is here.
I don’t. It’s fine. I’ll just be a second.
Mute.
I’ll get this stuff out of here.
Will I?
I would like to be. Got a minute?
Come on, you just got off the phone. You’re fine. 30 seconds.
I was just driving over here, and I thought I was coming to basically apologise, but I’m not.
Look, that goes without saying, and I’m working on that. But I haven’t been entirely upfront with you, and I just want to try to make good. Can I move this? This is crazy. It’s like a Ferris wheel, going. I’m trying to get some…
Do you know how short life is? And if I never got to express… And by the way, this is somewhat revelatory to me. And I don’t care… I mean, I care. It would be nice. I’m not expecting you to… Look, here’s what I’m trying to say. I’m just gonna say it.
Yes.
Allergic to strawberries. This is progress Pepper. I knew there was a correlation between you and this.
I need you too.
That’s what I’m trying to…
I’m good, Hap.
I lost both the kids in the divorce. Are you blending in well here, Natalie? Here are Stark Enterprises? Your name is Natalie, isn’t it? I thought you two didn’t get along?
It’s just me you don’t care for. No? Nothing?
Boy, you’re good. You are mind-blowingly duplicitous. How do you do it? You just tear things… You’re a triple imposter. I’ve never seen anything like you. Is there anything real about you? Do you even speak Latin?
Which means? Wait. What? What did you just say?
You’re good. [Piles things up under desk spinny thing and throws strawberries in the bin. Goes back to the model and looks at it through one eye.
Jarvis, could you kindly Vac-U-Form a digital wire frame? I need a manipulatable projection.
How many buildings are there?
That was rhetorical. Just show me. What does that look like to you Jarvis? Not unlike an atom. In which case the nucleus would be here. Highlight the unisphere. Lose the footpaths. Get rid of them.
I’m discovering… Correction. I’m rediscovering a new element, I believe. Lose the landscaping, the shrubbery, the trees.
Thank Dad.
Get ready for a major remodel, fellas. We’re back in hardware mode.
Yeah. That was, like, three years ago. Where have you been?
Yeah, well, me too and it worked. Hey, I’m playing for the home team Coulson, you and all your Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers. Now, are you gonna let me work or break my balls?
That’s it. Bring that to me.
Perfectly level. I’m busy. What do you want?
Fantastic. Land of Enchantment.
Secret stuff?
Bye. Thanks.
Yeah, more than you know.
That was easy.
Dummy, You, can we clean up this mess? You’re killing me. You know I don’t…
My phone privilege is reinstated. Lovely. Coulson. How’s the Land of Enchantment?
You what?
You sound pretty sprightly for a dead guy.
Trace him.
Jarvis, where is he?
Sounds good. Let’s get together and hash it out.
You want to run some tests, run them. And assemble the suit while you’re at it. Put it together now.
I don’t want to hear it Jarvis. That tastes like coconut. And metal. Oh wow, yeah!
We got trouble.
Give them a wave.
All these people are in danger. We gotta get them out of here. You gotta trust me for the next five minutes.
Listen, I think he’s working with Vanko.
What is he?
Where’s Vanko?
Tell me.
Is that you?
Tony:
Jarvis, break in. I need to own him.
On what?
How are we doing Jarvis?
Nice work kid.
Let’s get this away from the Expo.
Got it.
Rhodey, you still locked on?
Drop your socks and grab your Crocs. We’re about to get wet on this ride.
I’m sorry buddy. Had to thin out the herd. What’s your 20?
Thank you very much, Agent Romanoff.
Yes, for the moment, I’m not dying. Thank you.
Is that you? No, I’m not. Not anymore.
I was going to tell you. I didn’t want to alarm you.
You didn’t let me.
I was gonna make you an omelette and tell you.
Great. Pepper?
I am fine. Don’t be mad. I will formally apologise…
…when I’m not fending off a Hammeroid attack.
We could have been in Venice.
Rhodes? Snap out of it buddy. I need you. They’re coming. Come on, let’s roll. Get up.
You okay?
Don’t be.
I’m the one who put you in this position. Forget it.
Thank you. That’s all I wanted to hear. Partner. They’re coming in hot, any second. What’s the play?
Got you. Where do you want to be?
What’re you talking about?
You have a big gun. You are not the big gun.
No. It’s subtle all the bells and whistles.
Fine. All right. You go up to. I’ll draw them in.
Okay, you got a spot. Where’s mine?
See that?
Rhodey? Get down.
Yeah. Sorry boss. I can only use it one. It’s a one-off.
With the what? Hammer tech?
I got this. Rhodes. I got an idea. You want to be a hero?
I could really use a sidekick. Put your hand up.
Yep.
Take it!
Pepper?
You can’t?
Look at me.
I think I did okay.
What did you just say? You’re done? That’s surprising. No, it’s not surprising. I get it. You don’t have to make excuses.
You actually were just making excuses. But you don’t have to.
Listen. Hey, hey. You deserve better.
You’ve taken such good care of me. I’ve been in a tough spot, but you got me through it, so… Right?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah. Let’s talk clean-up.
Okay. What about the press? Because you only had the job for a week. That’s gonna seem…
I know.
Weird.
It’s okay, right?
Run that by me again.
Yeah, so we’re not…
You should get lost.
I thought you were out of one-liners.
You kicked ass back there, by the way.
Not okay. Not okay with that.
How are you gonna resign if I don’t accept?
“Personality overview. Mr Stark displays compulsive behaviour.” In my own defence, that was last week. “Prone to self-destructive tendencies.” I was dying. I mean, please. Aren’t we all? “Textbook narcissism”? Agreed. Okay, here it is. “Recruitment assessment for Avenger Initiative. Iron Man? Yes.” I gotta think about it.
“Tony Stark not… Not recommended”? That doesn’t make any sense. How can you approve me but not approve me? I got a new ticker. I’m trying to do right by Pepper. I’m in a stable-ish relationship.
Then again, I will waive my customary retainer in exchange for a small favour. Rhodey and I are being honoured in Washington and we need a presenter.
Hey, do you want...?
I gave a speech? How was it?
Really?
It's my favorite kind, a winning combo.
Uh, to town on each other, probably back in your room. Cause I also wanna see your research.
Oh, I finally met a man called "Ho."
Oh, this guy.
Hey.
Who isn't? He means me.
Oh, wow. He made it. He made the cut.
Uh... she'll take both.
One to throw away and one to not call.
I see that, cause it's on your t-shirt.
Ladies first.
I'm titillated by the notion of working with you.
Yeah, cheese clown. I'll see you up on the roof in five minutes. I'm just going to try to get my beef wet real quick. You know what I'm talkin' about?
Damn betcha.
Come on! I thought that was just a theory.
Wow.
That's incredible. Essentially you're hacking into the genetic...
...of a...
...living organism.
Wow.
She's not like the others.Come on. Let's go in the bedroom. Happy...
Leave her ficus alone.
And you're starting with plants?
Huh.
It's revolutionary.
Changes the world.
You're the most gifted woman I've ever met.
In Switzerland.
This week.
You almost bought it, didn't you?
Have you checked the telomerase algorithm?
We're good.
You're...you're right on me. I made it. What the hell was that?
She was just talking about it. Glitches happening.
Hey!
Happy New Year.
Alright, I'll see you in the morning, goodnight.
Yep.
Okay.
So why am I telling you this? Because I had just created demons, and I didn't even know it.
Yeah, those were the good times. Then I moved on. After a brief soiree in an Afghan cave, I said goodbye to the party scene. Forgot that night in Switzerland. These days I'm a changed man, I'm different now. I'm well... you know who I am.
Ow!
No. Forty-eight. Ah! Micro-repeater implanting sequence complete.
Which I will. Right, let's do this.
Dummy. Hi, Dummy. How did you get that cap on your head? You earned it.
Hey. Hey! What are you doing round in the corner? You know what you did. Blood on my mat, handle it.
Focus up, ladies. Good evening, and welcome to the birthing suite. I'm pleased to announce the imminent arrival of your bouncing, bad-ass, baby brother.
Start tight and go wide, stamp in time. Mark 42 autonomous prehensile propulsion suit test. Initialize sequence.
Jarvis, drop my needle.
Crap.
Alright, I think we got this. Send 'em all.
Probably a little fast, slow it down. Slow it down just a...
...little bit.
Cool it, will you, Jarvis?
Come on. I ain't scared of you.
I'm the best.
And I guess seventy-two hours isn't a long time between siesta's. Didn't think it could get any worse. Then I had to go and turn on the TV.
That's when he happened.
I am Iron Patriot...
So what's really goin' on? With Mandarin. Seriously, can we talk about this guy?
Nine.
You know I can help, just ask. I got a ton of new tech, I got a prehensile, I got a...I got a new bomb disposal. Catches explosions mid-air.
Einstein slept three hours a year. Look what he did?
You're gonna come at me like that?
If Richard doesn't mind. You alright with this, Dick?
What's your name?
I loved you in A Christmas Story, by the way.
It's not superhero business, I get it.
That's why I said I...got it.
I broke the crayon.
What'd he say?!
Sorry. Have to check on the suit...make sure...okay.
Check the heart, check the...check the...is it the brain?
Okay, so I was poisoned?
Me?
Sorry, I gotta split.
Is this forehead of Security?
What? Harassing interns?
What's going on? Fill me in.
Yeah.
Right.
Oh, Yeah, yeah. You're the best.
Um...Switzerland.
Killian? No, I don't remember that guy.
His what?
Look at what? You watching them? Flip the screen and then we can get started.
Flip the screen, then I can see what they're doing.
Relax.
I'm just asking you to secure the perimeter. Tell him to go out for a drink or something?
A giant brain?
I miss you, Happy.
Hey, I...I'd hate to cut you off. Do you have your taser on you?
I think there's a gal in HR who's trying to steal some printer ink, you should probably go over there and zap her.
Uh...yeah. Something like that. You know everybody needs a hobby.
Just breakin' it in. You know, it's always a little pinchy in the gooey bag at first, so.
Oh hey, did you see your Christmas present?
Well actually, uh...it's a good question. I got a team of guys comin' tomorrow, they're gonna blow out that wall.
So, uh...tense? Good day?
Ooh shoulders, a little knotty. Naughty girl. I don't wanna harp on this, but did you like the custom rabbit?
Nailed it, right?
Huh. Yup, dammit. No can do. You wanna just kiss it on the...
The facial slit?
Crowbar. Yeah.
Oh, except there's been a...uh...a radiation leak.
That's risky.
At least let me get you like a Hazmat suit or a Geiger counter or something like that.
Busted.
Sorry.
He was just...
Well, yeah. I just mean we were just...just hosting you while I finished up a little work.
And yes, I had a quick bite. I didn't know if you were comin' home or if you were having drinks with Aldrich Killian.
What?
Happy was concerned.
I wasn't...
Hold on. Come on. Pep.
Hey, I admit it! My fault. Sorry.
I'm a piping hot mess. It's been going on for a while, I haven't said anything.
Nothing's been the same since New York.
You experience things and then they're over and you still can't explain 'em. Gods, aliens, other dimensions. I...I'm just a man in a can. The only reason I haven't cracked up is probably because you moved in. Which is great. I love you, I'm lucky. But, honey, I can't sleep. You go to bed, I come down here. I do what I know, I tinker.
But threat is imminent, and I have to protect the one thing that I can't live without. That's you. My suits, they're uh...
They're part of me.
Maybe.
Okay.
Better.
Power down!
I must have called it in my sleep. That's not supposed to happen. I'll recalibrate the sensors. Can we just...just let me...just let me catch my breath, okay?
Don't go, alright? Pepper?
Hi.
Uh...mind leaving that on?
Sunday night's PBS 'Downtown Abbey'. That's his show, he thinks it's elegant.
Is that what you want? Here's a little Holiday greeting I've been wanting to send to the Mandarin. I just didn't know how to phrase it until now. My name is Tony Stark and I'm not afraid of you. I know you're a coward, so I've decided
Okay, what do we got here? His name is an ancient Chinese war mantle, meaning "adviser to the King". South American insurgency tactics, talks like a Baptist preacher. There's lots of pageantry going on here...lots of theater.
No bomb parts found in a three mile radius of the Chinese theater.
Talk to me, Happy. Any military victims?
Bring up the thermogenic signatures again, factor in three thousand degrees.
Take away everywhere that there's been a Mandarin attack. That. You sure that's not one of his?
Bring her around.
That's two military guys. Ever been to Tennessee, Jarvis?
Are we still at "ding-dong"? We're supposed to be on total security lock down. Come on, I threatened a terrorist. Who is that?
Right there's fine. You're not the Mandarin, are you? Are you?
Don't take it personally, I don't remember what I had for breakfast.
That's right.
Normally, I'd go for that sort of thing, but now I'm in a committed relationship. It's...with her.
Yeah, it's Maya Hansen. Please don't tell me that there is a twelve year-old kid waiting in the car that I've never met.
What...what for? Why now?
I'll be fine.
We weren't.
She's not really.
Yep.
It was a great night.
What?
Okay, we've been through this. Nope.
The man says no.
Honey...
I'm sorry. That's a terrible idea. Please don't touch her bags.
I can't protect you out there. I challenged...
Yes, this is normal!
It's a big bunny, relax about it!
I got this for you.
You still haven't even told me that you liked it!
I asked you three... You don't like it?!
I said no.
What?
I got you first. Like I said, we can't stay here.
Jarvis, where's my flight power?!
That's one.
That's two.
Alright, kill the alarm. I got it.
It's snowing, right? Where are we, upstate?
Why?! Jarvis! Not my idea! What are we doing here? This is thousands of miles away, I gotta get Pepper, I gotta...
Who asked you? Open the suit.
Open eject. Maybe I'll just cozy back up for a bit.
Jarvis. Jarvis? Don't leave me, buddy.
Pepper, it's me. I've got a lot of apologies to make and not a lot of time. So first off, I'm so sorry I put you in harm's way. That was selfish and stupid and it won't happen again. Also, it's Christmas time, the rabbit's too big. Done. Sorry. And I'm sorry in advance because...I can't come home yet. I need to find this guy. You gotta stay safe. That's all I know. I just stole a poncho from a wooden Indian.
You got me. Nice potato gun. Barrel's a little long. Between that and the wide gauge, it's gonna diminish your FPS. And now you're out of ammo.
It's a electromagnet. You should know, you've got a box of them right here.
Technically, I am.
A valid point.
Life. I built him, I take care of him, I'll fix him.
Yeah.
It's Iron Patriot now.
No, it's not.
Retroreflective panels?
You want a stealth mode?
That's actually a good idea. Maybe I'll build one.
Not a good idea! What are you doing? You're gonna break his finger? He's in pain, he's been injured. Leave him alone.
Are you? Don't worry about it, I'll fix it. So, uh, who's home?
Mm. Which happens, dads leave. No need to be a pussy about it. Here's what I need: a laptop, a digital watch, a cell phone, the pneumatic actuator from your bazooka over there, a map of town, a big spring, and a tuna fish sandwich.
Salvation. What's his name?
The kid that bullies you at school, what's his name?
I got just the thing. Deal? Deal? What'd you say?
Deal? What's you're name?
The mechanic. Tony
Pepper, it's me. I've got a lot of apologies to make and not a lot of time. So first off, I'm so sorry I put you in harm's way. That was selfish and stupid and it won't happen again.
The sandwich was fair, the spring was a little rusty, the rest of the materials, I'll make do. By the way, when you said your sister had a watch, I was kinda hoping for something a little more than that.
Maybe never, relax about it.
I don't know, later. Hey kid, give me a little space. What's the official story here? What happened?
Six people died, right?
Including Chad Davis?
Yeah. That doesn't make sense. Think about it. Six dead, only five shadows.
Do you buy that?
No idea. I'm not...I don't care.
That's manipulative. I don't want to talk about it.
Maybe. Can you stop? Remember when I told you, that I have an anxiety issue?
Yeah, a little bit. Can I just catch my breath for a second?
Nope.
Probably.
I don't think so.
Remember when I said to stop doing that? I swear to God, you're going to freak me out! Ah man, you did it, didn't you? You happy now?
Your fault, you spazzed me out. Okay, back to business. Where were we? The guy who died...relatives? Mom? Mrs. Davis, where is she?
See, now you're being helpful.
Nice haircut, suits you.
Yeah, limited edition.
Mrs. Davis, mind if I join you?
It sure is.
I just want to say I'm sorry about your loss. I want to know what you think happened.
Clearly, you're waiting for someone else. Yeah? Supposed to meet somebody here?
Mrs. Davis, your son didn't kill himself, I guarantee you. He didn't kill anyone. Someone used him.
As a weapon.
Hey hot wings, you wanna party? You and me, let's go. Crazy, huh?
Watch this.
Sweetheart, that could be the name of my autobiography.
It's not your fault, kid. Remember what I told you about bullies.
For what? Did I miss something?
Yeah. A, saved you first. B, thanks, sort of. And C, if you do someone a solid, don't be a yutz, alright? Just play it cool otherwise you come off grandiose.
What I need is for you to go home, be with your mom, keep your trap shut, guard the suit and stay connected to the telephone because if I call, you better pick up. Okay, can you feel that? We're done here. Move it out the way or I'm going to run you over. Bye kid. I'm sorry, kid, you did good.
Yep Wait, you're guilt tripping me, aren't you?
Tony Stark:
Man. Happy, Happy, Happy-
You ever have a chick straddling you and you look up and suddenly she's glowing from the inside out, kind of a bright orange?
It's me, pal. Now, last time I went missing, if I remember correctly, you came looking for me. What are you doing?
Your redesign, your big rebrand, that was AIM, right?
I'm gonna find a heavy-duty comm sat right now, I need your login.
And password, please.
It's not the '80s, nobody says "hack" any more. Give me your login.
That is so much better than "lron Patriot."
That ain't gonna cut it.
Shh.
Shh. Keep it down.
No, he's not.
Come on in. Close the door. Shh...
Yep.
Okay. First, is this your van? Is anyone else gonna come in?
Great. What's your name?
Gary?
Right there is fine.
Okay? I get a lot of this, it's okay.
What do you want?
It's fine.
Right.
A Hispanic Scott Baio. I'm sorry. Is that me?
Gary. Listen to me, okay? I don't want to clip your wings, here. We're both a little over-excited. I got an issue. I'm chasing bad guys. I'm trying to grab a little something from some hard-crypt data files. I don't have enough juice. I need you to jump on the roof... Right? Recalibrate the lSDNs. Pump it up by about 40%.
All right? It's a mission.
Tony needs Gary.
Be quiet about it. Go.
A bomb is not a bomb when it's a misfire. The stuff doesn't always work. Right, pal? It's faulty, but you found a buyer, didn't you? Sold it to the Mandarin. Got you, pal.
Harley, tell me what's happening. Give me a full report.
How much have you had?
Can you still see straight?
That means you're fine. Give me Jarvis. Jarvis, how are we?
What are we talking? Far East, Europe, North Africa, Iran, Pakistan, Syria? Where is it?
Okay, kid, I'm gonna have to walk you through rebooting Jarvis's speech drive, but not right now. Harley, where is he really? Just look on the screen and tell me where it is.
Okay, first things first, I need the armour. Where are we at with it?
What's questionable about electricity? All right? It's my suit, and I can't... I'm not gonna... I don't wanna... Oh, God, not again.
Right, and then you just said it by name while denying having said it.
God, what am I gonna do?
Right.
Yes, I did.
Okay. Thanks, kid.
Hey!
Don't move.
What?
Heard enough. You're not him. The Mandarin, the real guy. Where? Where's the Mandarin? Where is he?
What do you mean?
It is?
Uncomplicate it. Ladies, out. Get out of the bed. Get into the bathroom. Sit.
What are you? What are you, a decoy? You're a double, right?
You got a minute to live. Fill it with words.
Then how did you get here, Trevor?
Next?
What did they say? They'd get you off them?
Did you just nod off? Hey.
"He"? Killian?
He created you?
Custom-made terror threat.
Your performance? Where people died?
I'm sorry, but I got a best friend who's in a coma and he might not wake up. So you're gonna have to answer for that. You're still going down, pal. You under...
Ah... Okay.
Oh, yeah. With zip ties. It's a ball.
Okay. So you took Killian's card.
And here you are 13 years later, in a dungeon.
Yeah.
Yeah?
I'm on the street. People are going bang. They're painting the walls. Maya, you're kidding yourself.
Did I do that?
I remember the night, not the morning. Is this what you've been chasing around?
I can't help you. You used to have a moral psychology. You used to have ideals. You wanted to help people. Now look at you. I get to wake up every morning with someone who still has their soul. Get me out of here. Come on.
You're not still pissed off about the Switzerland thing, are you?
Honestly, I'm still trying to figure out what happened to the first mouse.
You're something else.
Yes. Sir Laurence Oblivier.
What's next for you in your world?
You are a maniac.
Careful, there. It's a limited edition. Hey, uh, Ponytail Express. What's the mileage count between Tennessee and Miami?
Very nice.
Break it, you bought it.
Okay, that wasn't mine to give away. That belongs to my friend's sister. And that's why I'm gonna kill you first.
You'll see.
Trust me, you're gonna be in a puddle of blood on the ground in five, four, three... Come on! Two...
All right, I'm gonna give you a chance to escape. Put down your weapons. Tie yourselves to those chairs. I'll let you live. In five, four, bang!
You should be gone by now. You should've already been gone.
Here it comes. Three, four...
Tony Stark:
Ah! Better late than never. Not this time. Not the face. Phew! It's good to be back. Hello, by the way.
Ah! Let's go! Aw, crap.
Rhodey, tell me that was you in the suit.
Uh... Mmm. Kind of. Main house, as fast as you can. There's somebody I'd like you to meet.
The room is secure. I have eyes on the Mandarin.
What have you come as?
Tony Stark:I never thought people had been hurt. They lied to me.
Tony Stark:Yeah, I know, it's... It's embarrassing.
Tony Stark:Here's how it works, Meryl Streep.
Spill.
What? No. But I do know it's happening off the coast. Something to do with a big boat. I can take you there.
Oh, and this next bit may include the vice president as well. Is that... Is that important?
So?
Right. Hey, Ringo. Didn't you say something about a "lovely speedboat"? If he's right about the location, we're 20 minutes from where Pepper is.
Right. I wonder who I'm calling right now. Oh! That's the vice president.
Sir, this is Tony Stark.
We believe you're about to be drawn into the Mandarin campaign. We gotta get you somewhere safe as soon as possible.
And what about the suit I'm wearing?
That's going to have to do.
The President. Now.
Walk away from that, you son of a bitch. How many in the air?
How many can I carry?
Slow down. Slow down, relax. What's your name? Heather?
Listen to me. See that guy? I'm gonna swing by, you're just gonna grab him. You got it?
I'll electrify your arm, you won't be able to open your hand. We can do this, Heather. Easy, see? Eleven more to go. Remember that game called Barrel of Monkeys? That's what we're going to do.
Come on, people. Everybody, grab your monkey. Nice.
Come on, people. Come on, come on, come on! Yeah!
He's a chunky monkey, let's get him. Hello.
Nice work, guys! Excellent. Good team effort all around. Go us. All right, Jarvis. But it's only half-done. We've still got to get Pepper...
I think they all made it.
Yeah, but I missed the president.
Uh... Say, Jarvis, is it that time?
Correct.
I hope not.
Viking funeral. Public execution.
Yep. What do I do?
Six, high, back. Alright. You see that? Nailed it.
You think I was aiming for the bulb? You can't hit a bulb at this distance.
I'm out. Give me. You got extra magazines?
I know what I'm doing, I make this stuff. Give me another one.
Give me one of yours.
You've got, like, five of them. Here's what I'm going to do. Save my spot, ready?
Too fast. Nothing. Here we go. Three guys, one girl, all armed.
You're right. We need backup.
You know what?
Yep.
Yeah. Merry Christmas, buddy. JARVIS, target Extremis heat signatures. Disable with extreme prejudice.
What are you waiting for? It's Christmas. Take them to church.
Incoming! Jarvis, get Igor to steady this thing.
Everybody needs a hobby. Heartbreaker, help Red Snapper out, will you? Nice timing.
Oh, I'm sorry, they're only coded to me.
I got you covered.
About time.
See what happens when you hang out with my ex-girlfriends?
Yep. We'll talk about it over dinner.
Yeah, you take a minute. Oh, come on!
Nice work.
Pep, I got you. Relax, I got you. Just look at me! Honey, I can't reach any further and you can't stay there. All right? You've got to let go. You've got to let go! I'll catch you, I promise. No!
Eject.
I'll be damned. The prodigal son returns. Whatever.
Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait! Slow down! Slow down! You're right. I don't deserve her. Here's where you're wrong. She was already perfect. Jarvis, do me a favour and blow Mark 42.
I got nothing. Honey?
You just scared the devil out of me. I thought you were...
It's still debatable. Probably tipping your way a little bit. Why don't you dress like this at home? Hmm? Sport bra. The whole deal.
Well, it's me. You'll think of something. Come here.
Don't worry about it.
No, you're not. Not hot.
No. You're in a relationship with me. Everything will never be okay. But I think I can figure this out, yeah. I almost had this 20 years ago when I was drunk. I think I can get you better. That's what I do. I fix stuff.
Uh... I'm going to shave them down a little bit. Jarvis. Hey.
You know what to do.
Screw it, it's Christmas. Yes, yes. Okay, so far? Do you like it?
To be able to share all my intimate thoughts and my experiences with someone, it just cuts the weight of it in half. You know, it's like a snake swallowing its own tail. Everything comes full circle. Are you with me?
Are you actively napping?
Where did I lose you?
So, you heard none of it?
So?
What? The time?
You know what? Now that I think about it... Oh! God, my original wound. 1983, all right?
I'm 14 years old, I still have a nanny. That was weird.
You're good on this end. The rest is up to you.
Stark Tower is about to become a beacon of self-sustaining clean energy.
I assume. Light her up.
Like Christmas, but with more... me.
Pepper, you're killing me. Remember the moment? Enjoy the moment.
I'm not in. I'm actually out.
Grow a spine, Jarvis. I got a date.
Of course they are, I was directly involved. Which brings me to my next question: how does it feel to be a genius?
What do you mean? All this came from you.
Give yourself some credit, please. Stark Tower is your baby. Give yourself... twelve percent of the credit.
An argument can be made for fifteen.
Well, I did do all the heavy lifting. Literally, I lifted the heavy things. And sorry, but the security snafu? That was on you.
My private elevator...
Was steaming with sweaty workmen. I'm going to pay for that comment about percentages in some subtle way later, aren't I?
I'll tell you what. Next building's gonna say 'Potts' on the tower.
Call your mom, can you bunk over?
You have reached the life model decoy of Tony Stark, please leave a message.
Then leave it urgently. That's on you.
Phil? Uh, his first name is Agent.
Which is why he can't stay.
I don't like being handed things.
Official consulting hours are between eight and five every other Thursday.
The Avengers Initiative was scrapped, I thought. And I didn't even qualify.
Yeah, apparently I'm volatile, self-obsessed, don't play well with others.
Whatever. Miss Potts, got a minute?
You know, I thought we were having a moment.
How did you notice? Why is he Phil?
This is, uh... This.
Tomorrow.
Well, what if I didn't?
Yeah.
Square deal. It's the last date.
Agent Romanoff, did you miss me? Make your move, Reindeer Games.
Good move.
Captain.
What? Rock of Ages giving up so easily?
Still, you are pretty spry, for an older fellow. What's your thing? Pilates?
It's like calisthenics. You might have missed a couple things, you know, during your time as a Capsicle.
Yeah, there's a lot of things Fury doesn't tell you.
Now there's that guy.
Doesn't matter. If he frees Loki or kills him, the Tesseract's lost. Tony turns and gets ready to jump off the jet to chase after Thor.
I have a plan. Attack.
Then don't take my stuff.
Shakespeare in the park? Doth mother know you weareth her drapes?
He gives up the Cube, he's all yours. Until then, stay out of my way... tourist.
Okay.
How about that?
Um, yeah, no! Bad call! He loves his hammer!
It's a stabilizing agent. I'll fly you there. Keep the love alive. Means the portal won't collapse on itself, like it did at SHIELD.
Well, that sounds exhausting. The rest of the raw materials, Agent Barton can get his hands on pretty easily. Only major component he still needs is a power source. A high energy density, something to kick start the cube.
Last night. The packet, Selvig's notes, the Extraction Theory papers. Am I the only one who did the reading?
Unless, Selvig has figured out how to stabilize the quantum tunneling effect.
Finally, someone who speaks English.
Shall we play, doctor?
If we bypass their mainframe and direct a reroute to the Homer cluster, we can clock this around six hundred teraflops.
You know, you should come by STARK TOWER sometime. Top ten floors, all R&D. You'd love it, it's candy land.
Well, I promise a stress free environment. No tension. No surprises.
Nothing?
You really have got a lid on it, haven't you? What's your secret? Mellow jazz? Bongo drums? Huge bag of weed?
Funny things are.
You're tiptoeing, big man. You need to strut.
You think I'm not? Why did Fury call us and why now? Why not before? What isn't he telling us? I can't do the equation unless I have all the variables.
He's a spy. Captain, he's the spy. His secrets have secrets. It's bugging him too, isn't it?
That's just the prototype. I'm kind of the only name in clean energy right now.
I should probably look into that once my decryption programmer finishes breaking into all of SHIELD's secure files.
Jarvis has been running it since I hit the bridge. In a few hours we'll know every dirty secret SHIELD has ever tried to hide. Blueberry?
An intelligence organization that fears intelligence? Historically, not possible.
Following is not really my style.
Of the people in this room, which one is; A. wearing a spangly outfit, and B. not of use?
That's the guy my dad never shut up about? Wondering if they shouldn't have kept him on ice.
What he's got is an ACME dynamite kit. It's gonna blow up in his face, and I'm gonna be there when it does.
Uh-huh. Or you'll be suiting up like the rest of us.
You know, I've got a cluster of shrapnel, trying every second to crawl its way into my heart. This stops it. This little circle of light. It's part of me now, not just armor. It's a... terrible privilege.
Because I learned how.
Hey, I've read all about your accident. That much gamma exposure should have killed you.
I guess we'll find out.
You just might.
Uh...kind of been wondering the same thing about you.
And you'll get your cube back, no muss, no fuss. What is PHASE 2?
I'm sorry, Nick.
What were you lying?
Nuclear deterrent. `Cause that always calms everything right down.
Wait! Wait! Hold on! How is this now about me?
You're on that list? Are you above or below angry bees?
Threatening! I feel threatened!
Why shouldn't the guy let off a little steam?
Oh, I'm starting to want you to make me.
Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist.
I think I would just cut the wire.
A hero? Like you? You're a lab rat, Rogers. Everything special about you came out of a bottle!
Got it.
I can get there faster.
You gonna stop me?
I'm not afraid to hit an old man.
Yep!
Find engine three. I'll meet you there.
Good. See what we got.
I gotta get this super conducting cooling system back online before I can access the rotors and work on dislodging the debris.
I need you to get to that engine control panel and tell me which relays are in overload position.
What's it look like in there?
Well, you're not wrong.
Even if I clear the rotors, this thing won't re-engage without a jump. I'm gonna have to get in there and push.
Then stay in the control unit and reverse polarity long enough to disengage mag…
See that red lever? It'll slow the rotors down long enough for me to get out. Stand by it, wait for my word.
Yeah. Noticed.
Cap, I need the lever!
Lever. Now!
No. There was a uh...cellist, I think.
He was an idiot.
For taking on Loki alone.
He was out of his league. He should have waited. He should have…
Right. How did that work for him?
WE ARE NOT SOLDIERS! I am not marching to Fury's fife!
He made it personal.
That is the point. That's Loki's point. He hit us all right where we live. Why?
He had to conquer his greed, but he knows he has to take us out to win, right? That's what he wants. He wants to beat us and he wants to be seen doing it. He wants an audience.
Yeah. That's just a preview, this is opening night. Loki's a full-tilt diva. He wants flowers, he wants parades, he wants a monument built in the skies with his name plastered… Sonofabitch!
Shut it down, Dr. Selvig.
Okay.
Skip the spinning rims. We're on the clock.
Uh...actually, I'm planning to threaten you.
Yeah, it's seen a bit of mileage. You've got the blue stick of destiny. Would you like a drink?
No, no, no! Threatening. No drink? You sure? I'm having one.
THE AVENGERS. It's what we call ourselves, sort of like a team. `EARTH'S MIGHTIEST HEROES' type of thing.
Yeah, takes us a while to get any traction, I'll give you that one. But, let's do a head count here. Your brother, the demigod; a super soldier, a living legend who kind of lives up to the legend; a man with breath-taking anger management issues; a couple of master assassins, and you, big fella, you've managed to piss off every single one of them.
Not a great plan. When they come, and they will, they'll come for you.
We have a HULK.
You're missing the point. There's no throne, there is no version of this, where you come out on top. Maybe your army comes and maybe it's too much for us, but it's all on you. Because if we can't protect the Earth, you can be damned well sure we'll avenge it.
Well, performance issues. You know? Not uncommon. One out of five…
Jarvis. Anytime now.
And there's one other person you pissed off! His name was Phil.
Right. Army.
What, did you stop for drive-thru? Swing up PARK, I'm gonna lay 'em out for you.
Fine. Let's keep them occupied.
I'm seeing, still working on believing. Where's Banner? Has he shown up yet?
Just keep me posted. Jarvis, find me a soft spot.
We got his attention. What the hell is step two?!
Then tell him to suit up. I'm bringing the party to you.
Call it, Cap.
Right. Better clench up, LEGOLAS.
Just try and keep them off the streets.
I will roger that.
Nice call. What else you got?
And he didn't invite me?
JARVIS. You ever hear the tale of Jonah?
Jarvis, put everything we got into the thrusters!
I got a nuke coming in, it's gonna blow in less than a minute.
And I know just where to put it.
You might as well.
What the hell?
What just happened? Please tell me nobody kissed me.
Alright, hey...
Alright. Good job, guys.
Let's just not come in tomorrow...let's just...take a day.
Have you ever tried shawarma? There's a shawarma joint about two blocks from here. I don't know what it is, but I wanna try it.
And then shawarma after.
You don't need to do that. Because uh... you're just holding position. That's a goal. We're now one apiece.
We're tied up. Feel the tension? It's fun.
That was terrible. Now you have a chance to win.
And... you've won. Congratulations.
Fair game. Good sport. Have fun?
This thing on? But it's now dead in the water. We're 1000 light years from the nearest 7-11. Oxygen will run out tomorrow. And that'll be it. And Pep, I ... I know I said no more surprises, but I was really hoping to pull off one last one. But it looks like... well you know what it looks like. Don't feel bad about this. I mean, if you grovel for a couple of weeks, and then move on with enormous guilt. I should probably lie down. Please know that... when I drift off, I will think about you. Because it's always you.
Couldn't stop him.
I lost the kid.
Is, uh...?
It's okay.
Where is he now? Where?
What's wrong with him?
Honestly, until this exact second, I literaly thought you were a Build-A-Bear.
Who told you that? I didn't fight him. No, he wiped my face with a planet while the Bleecker Street Magician gave away the store. That's what happened. There was no fight.
He's unbeatable.
Pfft! I saw this coming a few years back. I had a vision. I didn't wanna believe it. Thought I was dreaming.
I need to shave. And I believe I remember telling all youse -
Alive and otherwise what we needed was a suit of armor around the world! Remember that? Whether it impacted our precious freedoms or not- that's what we needed!
I said, "we'd lose". You said, "We'll do that together too." And guess what, Cap? We lost. And you weren't there. But that's what we do, right? Our best work after the fact? We're the Avengers, we're the Avengers. Not the Prevengers.
Right?
Okay...
Nah, nah. Here's my point. You know what?
She's great, by the way.
We need you. You're new blood. Bunch of tired old mules! I got nothing for you, Cap! I got no coordinates, no clues, no strategies, no options. Zero. Zip. Nada. No trust. Liar.
Here, take this. You find him, and you put that on. You hide.
I'm fine. I...
Okay, You should not be wearing that, okay? That is part of a special anniversary gift I'm making for Mom.
There you go. Are you thinking about lunch? I can give you a handful of crickets on a bed of lettuce.
That's what you want. How did you find this?
Really? Were you looking for it?
You like going to the garage, huh? So does daddy. It's fine, actually. Your mom never wears anything I buy her.
Quantum fluctuation messes with the Planck Scale, which then triggers the Deutsch Proposition. Can we agree on that?
In Layman's terms, it means you're not coming home.
No, you accidentally survived. It's a billion to one cosmic fluke. And now you wanna pull off a... What do you call it?
Yeah, a time heist. Of course, why didn't we think of this before? Oh, because it's laughable? Because it's a pipedream?
Or screw it up worse than he already has, right?
Gotta say, sometimes I miss that giddy optimism. However, high hopes won't help if there's no logical, tangible way for me to safely execute said time heist. I believe the most likely outcome would be our collective demise.
I'm gonna stop you right there, Scott. Are you seriously telling me that your plan to save the universe is based on Back To The Future?
Good. You had me worried there. 'Cause that'd be horse shit. That's not how quantum physics works.
We did stand. And yet, here we are.
That's right, Scott, I won't even. I got a kid.
Good job. I'm saved. I wish you'd come here to ask me something else. Anything else. Honestly, I... I missed you guys, it was... Oh, and table's set for six.
Look at a mod inspiration, let me see what check out. So, recommend one last sim before we pack it in for the night. This time, in the shape of a mobius strip, inverted, please.
Give me that eigenvalue. That, particle factoring, and a spectral decomp. That will take a second.
And don't worry if it doesn't pan out. I'm just kinda -
Shit!
What are you doing up, little mess?
No, we don't say that. Only Mommy says that word. She coined it, it belongs to her.
'Cause I got some important shit going on here. What do you think? No, I got something on my mind. I got something on my mind.
Sure was. That's extortion. Great minds think alike. Juice Pops, exactly was on... my mind.
You done? Yeah, now you are. That face goes there.
A story... Once upon a time, Maguna went to bed. The end.
Come on, that's your favorite story. I love you tons.
Go to bed. Or I'll sell all your toys. Night, night.
Not that it's a competition, but she loves me 3000. You were somewhere on the low 6 to 900 range.
What are you reading?
What's new with composting?
I figured it out, by the way.
Time travel.
That's right.
Yeah, I know.
No, I can't help everybody.
Not if I stop. I can put a pin in it right now, and stop.
I sometimes feel I should put it in a locked box and drop it at the bottom of a lake... go to bed.
Why the long face? Let me guess: He turned into a baby.
That's the EPR Paradox. Instead of pushing Lang through time, you might've wound up pushing time through Lang. It's tricky. Dangerous. Somebody should've cautioned you against it.
Oh, did I? Turns out, resentment is corrosive, and I hate it.
We got a shot at getting these stones, but I gotta tell you my priorities: Bring back what we lost? I hope, yes. Keep what I got? I have to, at all costs. And... maybe not die trying will be nice.
Why? He made it for you. Plus, honestly I have to get it out of the garage before Morgan takes it sledding.
Will you keep that a little quiet? Didn't bring one for the whole team. ...We are getting the whole team, yeah?
Ratchet, How's it going?
Well I'd substitute the word encounter for damn well near been killed by one of the six Infinity Stones.
Our history. So, not a lot of convenient spots to just drop in.
Correct.
Awesome. Eggs? Breakfast?
Ear-nose-throat meets rabbit from a hat.
Yeah. Sullivan Street.
No. He lived in Toronto. Were you even paying attention?
All right. You heard the man. Stroke those keys, jolly green.
Got to hustle, Cap. Things look like they're just about wrapped up here.
Uh, Mr. Rogers. I almost forgot that that suit did nothing for your ass.
It's ridiculous.
They are SHIELD...Well, actually Hydra. But, we didn't know that yet.
You're small, but you're talking loud.
All right, you're up, little buddy. There's our stone.
All right, Cap. I got our scepter in the elevator just passing the 80th floor.
Alright. I'll see you there.
Thumbelina, do you copy? I've got eyes on the prize. It's go-time.
Yeah, I had a can just for emergencies. Relax. Can we focus, please?
All right, move it, Stuart Little. Things are getting dicey up here. Let's go.
You're only giving me a mild cardiac dysrhythmia.
Do it, Lang!
Window's closing. Pull my pin!
MEDIC! You guys, some help!
Good job. Meet me in the alley. I'm gonna grab a quick slice.
Oh, we blew it.
Cap–
Sorry, buddy. We got a– problem.
You know what? Give me a break, Steve. I just got hit in the head with the Hulk.
You're repeating yourself, you know that? You're repeating yourself.
Dude, come on.
I dropped the ball.
Is that what I did?
I got it. There's another way. To retake the Tesseract and acquire new particles. We'll stroll down memory lane. Military installation, Garden State.
They were there at a– I've a vaguely exact idea.
I know for a fact they were there–
And I know how I know.
Well, it looks like we're improvising.
Scott, get this back to the compound.
Suit up.
0-4,
Uhh, 0-7.
1-9-7-0.
Thanks for the pep talk, pissant. Do you trust me?
Your call.
Clearly, you weren't actually born here, right?
Right. Well, imagine you're SHIELD, running a quasi-fascistic intelligence organization. Where do you hide it?
Good luck on your mission, Captain.
Gotcha. Back in the game.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, no, Dr. Zol– No, I haven't seen a soul. Pardon me.
No, sir. I'm a– a visitor from MIT.
Uh– Howard.
Howard– Potts.
Hi.
Yeah–
I'm fine. Just, long hours.
Yeah. That would be swell.
Okay.
So, flowers and sauerkraut. You got a big date tonight?
Congratulations.
Yeah, sure. How far along is she?
I have a little girl.
What'd be so awful about that?
So, where are you at with names?
Huh, Might wanna let that stew awwhile. You got time.
Wildly. Yeah.
I literally pieced it together as I went along, I thought about what my Dad did, and–
I thought my dad was tough on me. And now, looking back, I just remember the good stuff, you know. He did drop the odd pearl.
"No amount of money ever bought a second of time."
He did his best.
Yeah, Howard– Everything's gonna be all right. Thank you– for everything– you've done for this country.
Do we know if she had family?
I just asked him a question–
It's not about that–
Yeah.
Good to go, yeah?
You remember– everyone Thanos snapped away five years ago and just bringing them back to now, today. Don't change anything from the last five years.
F.R.I.D.A.Y., do me a favor and activate Barn Door Protocol. Will you?
Talk to me, Banner.
Don't move him.
Come on, buddy. Wake up. That's my man. You lose this again, I'm keeping it.
You messed with time. It tends to mess back. You'll see.
What's he been doing?
Somewhere under all this. All I know is he doesn't have them.
Yeah. And I don't much care.
Yep. We're all kinds of stubborn.
Okay, Thor. Hit me.
No way to get them back. Thanos destroyed the quantum tunnel.
Scott, how long you need to get that thing working?
Hey. You said one out of 14 million, we win, yeah? Tell me this is it.
You better be right.
F.R.I.D.A.Y., what are they firing at?
And I– am– Iron Man.
Hey, Pep..
And who's “we”?
Bruce.
You okay?
Tell me his name again.
This is him...What's our timeline?
Did you seriously just say “hither to undreamt of”?
Is that what this is...?
I'm going to allow that. If Thanos needs all six, why don't we just stick this one down the garbage disposal?
And I swore off dairy, but then, Ben & Jerry's named a flavor after me, so...
It's not bad.
Whatever. Point is: Things change.
And still conversely, it may also be his best chance against us.
What is your job exactly, besides making balloon animals?
Yeah, that's the thing.
Two weeks ago, Vision turned off his transponder. He's offline.
I didn't lose him. He's more than that. He's evolving.
Shit. Probably Steve Rogers.
Maybe. But...
It's not that easy. God, we haven't caught up in a spell, have we?
The Avengers broke up. We're toast.
Cap and I fell out hard. We're not on speaking terms.
Say, Doc, you wouldn't happen to be moving your hair, would you?
You okay?
Help him! Wong, Doc.
F.R.I.D.A.Y., what am I looking at?
Hey! You might wanna put that Time Stone in your back pocket, Doc!
F.R.I.D.A.Y., evac anyone south of 43rd Street, notify first responders.
I'm sorry, Earth is closed today. You better pack it up and get outta here.
It means get lost Squidward!
Banner, you want a piece?
That's right.
Been a while. Good to have you, buddy.
Where's your guy?
There's no time for a thing.
That's the thing right there. Let's go.
{Glances at Strange] Dude, you're embarrassing me in front of the wizards.
It's okay. Hey, stand down. Keep an eye on him. Thank you.
It's nano-tech. You like it? A little somet-
Gotta get that stone outta here, now.
Exactly. Bye.
Really, really good. Really good. Do you plan on helping out?
Hammer.
Kid, where'd you come from?
He's from space. He came here to steal a necklace from a wizard.
Kid, that's the wizard. Get on it.
Hang on, kid. Pete, you gotta let go. I'm gonna catch you.
You're too high up. You're running out of air.
Happy trails, kid. F.R.I.D.A.Y, send him home.
Yeah, I'm fine. I just think we might have to push our 8:30 res.
Just 'cause I'll... probably not make it back for awhile.
Yeah.
Honey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I don't know what to say.
Pep...
Wow you're a seriously loyal piece of outerwear, aren't you?
What the-
You should not be here.
I don't wanna hear it.
And now I gotta hear it.
What did you just say?
Yeah. Right where I don't want you to be. This isn't Coney Island. This isn't a field trip. It's one-way ticket. You hear me? Don't pretend like you thought this through. You could not have possibly thought this through.
You could not have possibly thought this through.
Come on. We got a situation. See him down there? He's in trouble. What's your plan? Go.
I gotta tell you, he's not really my friend. Saving his life is more a professional courtesy.
Yeah, but the kid's seen more movies.
Yeah. Now he wants to run. Great plan.
And I want you to thank me. Go ahead. I'm listening.
Who just saved your magical ass? Me.
Admit it. You should have ducked out when I told you to. I tried to bench you. You refused.
And due to that fact, we're now in a flying doughnut billions of miles away from Earth with no backup.
No. You're a stowaway. The adults are talking.
This ship is self-correcting its course. Thing's on autopilot.
Yeah.
Yeah I heard you. I'm thinking...I'm not so sure we should.
No. It's you who doesn't understand. Thanos has been inside my head for six years...Since he sent an army to New York and now he's back! And I don't know what to do. So I'm not so sure if it's a better plan to fight him on out turf or his but you saw what they did, what he can do. At least on his turf, he's not expecting it. So I say we take the fight to him. Doctor. Do you concur?
Good. Nice. Moral compass. We're straight. Alright, kid. You're an Avenger now.
I think we're here. I don't think this rig has a self-park function. Get your hand into this steering gimbal. Close those around it. You understand?
This was meant for one big guy, so we gotta to move at the same time.
We might wanna turn.
You alright?
That was close. I owe you one.
I don't wanna hear another single pop culture out of you for the rest of the trip. You understand?
Yeah, I'll do you one better. Who's Gamora?
Let's do it! You shoot my guy, I blast him. Let's go!
You're from Earth?
Yeah, that's on Earth dip-shit. What are you hassling us for?
You know Thor?
Where is he now?
Yeah, we got one advantage. He's coming to us. We'll use it. All right, I have a plan. Or at least the beginnings of one. It's pretty simple. We draw him in, pin him down, get what we need. Definitely don't wanna dance with this guy. We just need the gauntlet.
Are you yawning? In the middle of this, while I'm breaking it down? Huh? Did you hear what I said?
Okay, Mr. Clean is on his own page.
Alright, just get over her, please. Mr. Lord can you get your folks to circle up?
We gotta coalesce. ‘Cause if all we come at him with is a plucky attitude..”
What dance-off?
Don't encourage this, alright?
We're getting no help from Flash Gordon here.
Your math is blowing my mind.
Strange, we alright?
You're back. You're alright. Hi.
How many did we win?
Piece of cake, Quill.
Is he under? Don't let up.
Parker, help! Get over here. She can't hold him much longer. Let's go. We gotta open his fingers to get it off!
Okay, Quill, you gotta cool it right now, understand?
Don't, don't, don't engage, we've almost got this off!
Hey, stop! Hey, stop! Stop! Hey, stop! Stop!
So this is it. It's all been leading to this.
Steady, Quill.
You're all right.
That's how I wished it happened. Binarily Augmented Retro-Framing, or BARF. God, I gotta work on that acronym. An extremely costly method of hijacking the hippocampus to . . . clear traumatic memories. Huh.
It doesn't change the fact that they never made it to the airport . . . or all the things I did to avoid processing my grief, but . . . Plus, 611 million dollars for my little therapeutic experiment? No one in the right mind would've ever funded it.
Help me out, what's the MIT mission statement? "To generate, disseminate . . . and preserve knowledge. And work with others . . . to bring it to bear on the world's great challenges." Well, you are the others. And, quiet as it's kept . . . the challenges facing you are the greatest mankind's ever known. Plus, most of you are broke.
Oh, I'm sorry. Rather, you were. As of this moment . . . every student has been made an equal recipient of the Inaugural September Foundation Grant. As in . . . all of your projects have just been approved and funded.
No strings, no taxes… just re-frame the future! Starting now.
Go break some eggs.
Restroom's this way, yeah?
It's . . . fine. I'll be right back.
Ah, they deserve it. Plus, it helps ease my conscience.
Are you going up?
Okay, okay. Hey! Sorry, it's an occupational hazard.
Boy, you know me so well.
Actually, I'm nursing an electromagnetic headache.
That's what's going on, Cap. It's just pain. It's discomfort. Who's putting coffee grounds in the disposal? Am I running a bed and breakfast for a biker gang?
Oh, that's Charles Spencer, by the way. He's a great kid. Computer engineering degree, 3.6 GPA. Had a floor level gig at Intel planned for the fall. But first, he wanted to put a few miles on his soul, before he parked it behind a desk. See the world. Maybe be of service. Charlie didn't want to go to Vegas or Fort Lauderdale, which is what I would do. He didn't go to Paris or Amsterdam, which sounds fun. He decided to spend his summer building sustainable housing for the poor. Guess where, Sokovia.
He wanted to make a difference, I suppose. I mean, we won't know because we dropped a building on him while we were kicking ass.
There's no decision-making process here. We need to be put in check! Whatever form that takes, I'm game. If we can't accept limitations, if we're boundary-less, we're no better than the bad guys.
Who said we're giving up?
That's good. That's why I'm here. When I realized what my weapons were capable of in the wrong hands, I shut it down and stop manufacturing.
If we don't do this now, it's gonna be done to us later. That's the fact. That won't be pretty.
Focus up. I'm sorry, did I just mishear you or did you agree with me?
No, no, no. You can't retract it. Thank you. Unprecedented. Okay, case closed--I win.
No. Romania was not Accords-sanctioned. And, Colonel Rhodes is supervising cleanup.
Consequences? You bet there'll be consequences. Obviously you can quote me on that 'cause I just said it. Anything else? Thank you, sir.
Secretary Ross wants you both prosecuted. Had to give him something.
Warmer than jail.
Hey, you wanna see something cool? I pulled something from Dad's archives. Felt timely. FDR signed the Lend-Lease bill with these in 1941. Provided support to the Allies when they needed it most.
See? If not for these, you wouldn't be here. I'm trying to . . . what do you call it? That's an olive branch. Is that what you call it?
We're kinda . . . well, not kinda . . .
No. Definitely not. We're taking a break. It's nobody's fault.
A few years ago, I almost lost her, so I trashed all my suits. Then, we had to mop up HYDRA . . . and then Ultron. My fault. And then, and then, and then, I never stopped. Because the truth is I don't wanna stop. I don't wanna lose her. I thought maybe the Accords could split the difference. In her defense, I'm a handful. Yet, Dad was a pain in the ass, but he and Mom always made it work.
Oh, really? You two knew each other? He never mentioned that. Maybe only a thousand times. God, I hated you.
I know, because you're a very polite person.
No, you don't.
Sometimes I wanna punch you in your perfect teeth. But I don't wanna see you gone. We need you, Cap. So far, nothing's happened that can't be undone, if you sign. We can make the last 24 hours legit. Barnes gets transferred to an American psych-center . . . instead of a Wakandan prison.
Sure. Once we put out the PR fire, those documents can be amended. I'd file a motion to have you and Wanda reinstated . . .
She's fine. She's confined to the compound, currently. Vision's keeping her company.
What? It's a 100 acres with a lap pool. It's got a screening room. There's worse ways to protect people.
She's not a US citizen.
And they don't grant visas to weapons of mass destruction.
GIVE ME A BREAK! I'm doing what has to be done . . . to stave off something worse.
FRIDAY, get me the source of that outage.
Sure did. It's a lovely Tom Ford, three-piece, two-button. I'm an active-duty non-combatant.
We will. GSG-9's got the borders covered. Recon's flying 24/7. They'll get a hit. We'll handle it.
All due respect, you're not going to solve this with boys in bullets, Ross. You gotta let us bring them in.
Because this time, I won't be wearing loafers and a silk shirt. 72 hours, guaranteed.
Thank you, sir. My left arm is numb, is that normal?
Always. 36 hours, jeez.
Oh, yeah. It'd be great if we had a Hulk right about now. Any shot?
No.
Me too. Where's yours?
Oh, Mr. Parker.
Tony.
It's about time we met. You've been getting my e-mails, right?
Right?
The September Foundation.
Yeah. Remember when you applied?
I approved, so now we're in business.
That's what I'm here to hash out.
It's so hard for me to believe that she's someone's aunt.
This walnut date loaf is exceptional.
Yeah?
Yeah.
It's pretty well funded.
Look who you're talking to. Can I have 5 minutes with him?
Whoa, what do we have here? Retro tech, huh? Thrift store? Salvation Army?
You're a dumpster diver.
Ah-ah! Me first.
Quick question of the rhetorical variety. That's you, right?
Yeah. Look at you go. Wow! Nice catch. 3,000 pounds, 40 miles an hour. That's not easy. You got mad skills.
Mm-Hmm.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah . . . oh, you mean like those UFOs over Phoenix?
Oh, what have we here?
So. You're the . . . Spider . . . ling. Crime-fighting Spider . . .you're Spider-Boy?
Not in that onesie, you're not.
Who else knows? Anybody?
Not even your . . . unusually attractive aunt?
You know what I think is really cool? This webbing. That tensile strength is off the charts. Who manufactured that?
Climbing the walls, how you doing that? Adhesive gloves?
Lordy! Can you even see in these?
You're in dire need of an upgrade. Systemic, top to bottom. 100-point restoration. That's why I'm here. Why you doing this? I gotta know. What's your MO? What gets you outta that twin bed in the morning?
Mm-Hmm.
Sure, because you're different.
So you wanna look out for the little guy? You wanna do your part? Make the world a better place, all that, right?
You got a passport?
You ever been to Germany?
Oh, you'll love it.
Why?
I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that.
Might be a little dangerous. Better tell Aunt Hottie I'm taking you on a field trip.
Alright, Spider-Man. Get me out of this.
Wow, it's so weird how you run into people at the airport. Don't you think that's weird?
Anyway, Ross gave me 36 hours to bring you in. That was 24 hours ago. Can you help a brother out?
Your judgment is askew. Your old war buddy killed innocent people yesterday.
All right, I've run out of patience. Underoos! Nice job, kid.
Yeah, we don't really need to start a conversation.
Yeah, we'll talk about it later. Just . . .
. . . Good job.
And you've been a complete idiot. Dragging in Clint. 'Rescuing' Wanda from a place she doesn't even want to leave, a safe place. I'm trying to keep . . . I'm trying to keep you from tearing the Avengers apart.
Alright, We're done. You're gonna turn Barnes over, you're gonna come with us. NOW! Because it's us! Or a squad of J-SOC guys . . . with no compunction about being impolite. Come on.
Oh, great. Alright, there's two on the parking deck. One of them's Maximoff, I'm gonna grab her. Rhodey, you want to take Cap?
What we discussed. Keep your distance. Web 'em up.
Wanda, I think you hurt Vision's feelings.
Okay. First, that's an exaggeration. Second, I did it to protect you. Hey, Clint.
Clearly, retirement doesn't suit you. You got tired of shooting golf?
First time for everything.
Yeah, I detected that too.
Well, my plan was to go easy on them. You wanna switch it up?
Neither are we.
Friday?
They what?
Who's speaking?
Friday?
Give me back my Rhodey.
Okay, anybody on our side hiding any shocking and fantastic abilities they'd like to disclose, I'm open to suggestion.
I don't know, I didn't carbon-date him. He's on the young side.
Maybe the kid's on to something.
Kid, you alright?
Same side. Guess who. Hi. It's me.
Yeah.
Yeah. You're done. Alright?
You did a good job. Stay down.
Stay down.
You're going home or I'll call Aunt May! You're done!
Rhodey!
RHODES! Read vitals.
How did this happen?
I didn't think that was possible.
The doctors say he shattered L4 through S1. Extreme laceration in the spinal cord. Probably looking at some form of paralysis.
You let them go, Nat.
'We'? Boy, it must be hard to shake the whole double agent thing, huh? It sticks in the DNA.
T'Challa told Ross what you did, so . . . they're coming for you.
What am I looking at, Friday?
Fire up the chopper.
Did you run facial recognition yet?
Uh, I don't know. I've been picturing a red head.
Must be.
So, what happened to the real Broussard?
Son of a bitch. Get this to Ross.
So? You got the files? Let's reroute the satellites, start facial scanning for this Zemo guy.
Give me a break, Barton. I had no idea they'll put you here. Come on.
Yeah, but not some super-max floating ocean pokey. You know, this place is for maniacs. This is a place for . . .
Because you broke the law.
I didn't make you.
You read it, you broke it.
Alright, you're all grown up, you got a wife and kids. I don't understand, why didn't you think about them before you chose the wrong side?
Who are you?
They're flying him to Columbia Medical tomorrow. So . . . fingers cross. What do you need? They feed you yet?
I'm just the guy who needs to know where Steve went.
Oh, I just knocked the 'A' out of their 'AV'. We got about 30 seconds before they realize it's not their equipment.
Clearly, I made a mistake. Sam, I was wrong.
Cap is definitely off the reservation but he's about to need all the help he can get. We don't know each other very well. You don't have to…
Easy.
Nope. Told me to go to hell. I'm going back to the compound instead, but you can call me anytime. I'll put you on hold, I like to watch the line blink.
You seem a little defensive.
At ease, Soldier. I'm not currently after you.
Could be your story's not so crazy. Maybe. Ross has no idea I'm here. I'd like to keep it that way. Otherwise, I gotta arrest myself.
You too, Cap.
I got heat signatures.
Uh, one.
I'm betting I could beat that.
I know that road. What is this?
Did you know?
Don't bullshit me, Rogers! Did you know?
Move!
Ah crap.
Come on, come on.
I'm eyeballing it. Do you even remember them?
I don't care. He killed my mom.
Analyse his fight pattern.
Tony Stark:
So was I. Stay down. Final warning.
That shield doesn't belong to you.
It's just the first pass.
Give me some feedback. Anything you can think of. Shock absorption. Lateral movement. Cup holder?
Let's go. I'll give you a hand.
You okay?
Yeah, put him through.
Ah, please hold.
